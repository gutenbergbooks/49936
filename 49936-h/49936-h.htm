<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It was not the author’s original intention to produce a
series of boys’ books. On the contrary, he expected that
his work in this line would begin and end with “The
American Boy’s Handy Book.”</p>

<p>The great popularity of that book is a constant source
of gratification and pleasure to the author; but he was not
a little surprised and embarrassed when he discovered
that in place of satisfying the lads he had only whetted
their appetite for more material in the same line. Letters
from boys in many parts of the British Provinces, and from
all over the United States, convinced the writer that he had
yet work to do for them, and the revised and enlarged
edition of “The American Boy’s Handy Book” was issued.
After a brief period of time the quaintly worded letters
in boyish handwriting began again to increase the mail
left at the author’s studio, and this time he laid aside his
brush and pencil to produce “The Outdoor Handy Book.”</p>

<p>It is hoped that the present demand for new ideas for
boys will be fully satisfied by “The Jack of All Trades.”
To the best of the author’s knowledge and belief there is
not a thing described in this book which has not been
proved practical by the experiments of himself or some boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
or boys. Parts of this book have appeared in various
periodicals, but all these chapters have been revised and
enlarged.</p>

<p>It is now a generally accepted truth that the so-called
skill of the hand is in reality the skill of a trained mind.
The necessity, in work or play, of constantly overcoming
new obstacles and solving new problems, develops a strong
and normal mind and body. There can be little doubt that
the rude schooling and hard knocks of a pioneer’s life rejuvenated
our race and developed those qualities in the
characters of Americans, without which Washington would
have been but a country gentleman and Lincoln a village
store-keeper. Had little Abe Lincoln been reared under
the care of a foreign woman with cap and ribbons (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> a
French nurse), his strong manly character would never
have been developed and our country would have lost one
of its grandest patriots and history its most unique figure.</p>

<p>Aside from these vitally important facts, art demands
that our youth should be encouraged to do things for themselves,
to produce things by their own labor. The most
finished product of the machine cannot appeal to the heart
of a real artist as does some useful and homely object
which still bears the marks of its maker’s hands.</p>

<p>For these reasons the author hopes that parents will
allow their boys to be boyish boys; and in order to keep
them out of mischief they will cater to the lads’ natural and
healthy desire for entertainment by encouraging them in
all rational projects and supplying them with tools and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
materials, so that the boys may all become juvenile Jacks
of All Trades.</p>

<p>It is the object of the author, in the chapters devoted to
animal life, to teach the boys to look upon all animals with
the same thoughtful kindness with which they might view
their own undeveloped brothers.</p>

<p>To Harper &amp; Brothers, and to <cite>The Ladies’ Home Journal</cite>
the thanks of the author are due for the careful preservation
and return of such original drawings as were used by
them in their respective publications, and without which
this work would be incomplete.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="titlefont">TREE-TOP CLUB HOUSES.</span></h2>


<p>It is now over thirty years since the writer was first
initiated into the delights of a boys’ club-house in the tree-tops,
and it happened in this way:</p>

<p>The war of the Rebellion was over; for four years the
fathers, big brothers, teachers, and policemen of the border
States had had so much serious fighting on their own hands
that little or no attention was paid to the growing generation
of boys, and they were left to fight their own battles in their
own way.</p>

<p>For four eventful years these boys were under practically
no other restraint than the little their poor half-distracted
mothers could enforce. The boys, however, did not appear
to miss the discipline, nor desire it, and, as far as their
physical health was concerned, they throve and developed
into lusty lads, though many of them recognized no law but
that of physical force.</p>

<p>Gangs of young toughs, under the leadership of local
bullies, frequented the play-grounds and roamed along the
river-fronts, where they hunted down, pillaged, and beat
every unprotected lad they could catch out of sight of his
own home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the river-fronts were the favorite
resorts of the lawless element, those places presented so
many attractions to the juvenile mind that they were the
popular play-grounds of all the boys living within reach of
their muddy banks and turbid waters.</p>

<p>About this time three boys of a Kentucky town, who
were devoted to boating and bathing, put their curly heads
together to devise a plan by which they might enjoy their
favorite pastimes, and at the same time secure a safe place
of refuge where they could hide when the enemy approached
in numbers too strong for the three boys to resist.</p>

<p>After many conferences, and references to “Robinson
Crusoe,” “Swiss Family Robinson,” “The Coral Islands,”
and other undoubted authorities, they decided to build an
underground house,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and armed with spades and shovels,
they immediately began work right in the heart of the
enemy’s country.</p>

<p>They worked, as only boys can when they think their
work is fun, and soon excavated a great hole in the river-bank.
Not far off were the remains of a flat-boat, and to the
heavy pieces of timber the boys harnessed themselves and
hauled the lumber over the top of their cave to serve for a
roof.</p>

<p>With spade and shovel they carefully concealed the
timber by a thick layer of earth, leaving only a square hole
with a trap-door as an entrance and exit. The dirt was then
smoothed down, and drift-wood, dried weeds, and other
rubbish scattered over in such a manner that no one, without
careful inspection, would suspect that the bank had been
tampered with.</p>

<p>But the enemy was alert, and spies had been stealthily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
watching the work progress, and patiently waiting the completion
of the secret hiding-place. No sooner was the last
handful of rubbish strewn over the roof than, with wild yells
and whoops of delight, the “River Rats” charged upon the
surprised workers.</p>

<p>“Big Red” Resmere in the lead, with “Squinty” Quinn
and “Spotty,” the freckled-face, close behind, while the rear
was brought up with a rabble of less noted characters, who
more than made up for their own lack of courage by their
terror-inspiring yells. It was too formidable a crowd for the
three cave-diggers to parley with, so they ingloriously fled
up the bank, leaving the product of their hard work in the
hands of the despoilers.</p>


<h3>The River Rats</h3>

<p>used the cave as headquarters, and for a long time afterward
would suddenly sally forth from the concealment of the
hole and surprise and beat any strange lad who was incautious
enough to venture in the neighborhood unprotected
by a company of friends. This adventure taught us several
things, and one night, at the “dark of the moon,” we met
in a smoke-house and formed ourselves into a secret society.
Over a bottle of strained honey we made solemn vows, and
the secrets of the society have never been divulged until
now.</p>

<p>The name, the purpose, and the fact of there being any
society were the three great secrets. The name was “The
Three Ancient Mariners.” The object was to stand by each
other to the crack of doom, and the seal, 3·A·M, was tattooed
on each member’s good right arm.</p>

<p>The vows were religiously kept, and many a bruised
face and discolored eye proved our loyalty to each other,
for the River Rats made constant war upon us, and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
peaceful plans for fun were often rudely upset by the sudden
appearance of a bright red head, followed by a freckled
face and a gang of retainers.</p>

<p>This persecution caused the production of</p>


<h3>A Tree-top Retreat,</h3>

<p>which, I believe, has never yet been discovered by the
enemy, nor any one else.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To reach our secret camp and
club-house we had to trudge along the dusty turnpike in
the hot sun, with no shade but that afforded by our wide-brimmed
straw hats. After passing an old-fashioned inn,
with its swinging sign decorated with a picture of the battle
of Buena Vista, we cut cross-lots over the forts and
rifle-pits on the hill-side, built by the Union soldiers at the
time of the Morgan raid. At the end of the lowest rifle-pit
we slid down the cut to the railroad track, and followed it
to the fence, with a hollow gate-post, where the bluebirds
always built their nests. Here we left the railway and entered
a cool belt of woods in which the dainty maidenhair-ferns
grew on the damp rotten logs and the gray squirrels
scolded us from the branches overhead. Following a private
trail, we reached an immense beech-tree which had grown
around a shaggy-barked hickory in such a manner that only
the roots and branches of the hickory could be seen, the
whole trunk being embedded and concealed by the smooth
bark of the beech, giving it the novel appearance of a tree
bearing two entirely different kinds of nuts.</p>

<p>Under the spreading branches of this compound tree
we generally rested awhile and took a look about us, to be
certain that the River Rats were not on our trail; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
diving into the hazel thicket, we emerged on the banks of
a tributary to the Licking River. A giant tulip-tree stood
on the bank of the creek, and a wild grape-vine, as thick as
your arm, dangled from the branches, which spread like an
umbrella sixty or seventy feet above us. The vine had
been cut loose from its roots on the shore, and its severed
end hung over a deep, dark pool.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Beginning a Two-tree
Foundation.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Secret Grape-Vine Route.</h3>

<p>No boy, outside the members
of the 3·A·M’s, would
look twice at the great snake-like
vine hanging over the
“lick,” and if he should, the
vine was far out of reach, and
would be passed by as suggesting
no possibilities of fun.</p>

<p>Well, that is where he
would make his mistake. Concealed
in the underwood back
of the tulip-tree was a long
pole with a hook on one end,
and by means of this implement
we could grapple the grape-vine and pull the end
within reach of our hands, and then one of us at a time
would grasp the vine securely with both hands, and stepping
back on the bank, give a short run, spring out into
mid-air and sail away across the deep hole to drop with a
thud upon the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Of course all this was unnecessary, for there were plenty
of shallow riffs near by where we could wade across; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
no lad with any romance in his soul would be guilty of such
baby-work when he knew the secret of the grape-vine route.</p>

<p>Once across we would peer carefully around in the most
approved Indian-scout fashion, and when satisfied the coast
was clear we would crouch down and make a wide detour
that would bring us to a large sycamore-tree, which had
been uprooted by the wind and fallen so that its top rested
in the fork of a towering oak-tree. The spreading roots of
the fallen sycamore made a wall of clay fully fifteen feet
high, which, with the surrounding underbrush and foliage,
effectually concealed the fact that in the branches of the
oak-tree rested a large and strange nest&mdash;a nest built by
wingless birds, for it was the club-house of the Three
Ancient Mariners! The leaning trunk of the uprooted
tree made a firm though slippery substitute for a ladder,
and here among the branches many a jolly day was passed,
and many a meal of fried fish, fresh from the neighboring
“lick,” was devoured by three happy, sunburned boys.</p>


<h3>Dangerous Toughs.</h3>

<p>Except in the neighborhood of large cities, there is nowadays
not much danger from gangs of brutal, half-grown
boys, but in those times the law seldom bothered any one.</p>

<p>However, even now, privacy and exemption from unwelcome
interruption are desirable, and this can be best
secured by</p>


<h3>A Club-House in the Tree-tops,</h3>

<p>for when the ladder is pulled up no one, without the aid of
“climbers,” such as line-men use, can hope to gain access
to the cosey little house in the branches.</p>

<p>If you can find a tree with three or four strong spreading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
branches, the problem of erecting a house is not a difficult
one. If there are four straight trees the proper distance
apart, it is a comparatively simple work to erect your house
between their trunks, high enough to be out of reach of
River Rats; but trees, as a rule, do not regulate their
growth to suit any set of boys, and the boys must use their
ingenuity to adapt their houses to the forms and growth of
the available trees.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Tree-top House. 6 × 10 feet, 35 feet from ground to floor.</p></div>
</div>

<p>First choose your location, and see that it is a desirable
one to all the club members; then, if there are any lofty
trees at</p>


<h3>The Desired Spot</h3>

<p>you will certainly find an opportunity for a four-tree,
three-tree, two-tree, or one-tree house.</p>

<p>The tree or trees for the purpose must be so tall, that
when the bottom ladder is pulled up the house will be out
of reach of unwelcome callers, and big enough to prevent
the wind from so swaying the house as to give a feeling of
insecurity.</p>


<h3>A Two-Tree House.</h3>

<p>Let us suppose that there are only two trees in the
proper location which fulfil the requirements, and that
these are tall pines with no branches of any importance
below their feather-duster-like tops. This presents one of
the most difficult problems to solve; but when you know
how, you can erect a most enchanting “crow’s-nest” away
up the tall trunks, where the fresh breeze blows over the
tops of the smaller trees, and where a good view can be
had of the surrounding country, and the enemy, if there
be one, may be seen while yet a long distance off, giving
ample time to the club members to pull up the ground
ladder and place themselves in position to laugh at the foe.</p>

</div>


<h3>How To Start.</h3>

<p>With an accomplished woodsman the whole edifice may
be erected with the use of no other tool than an axe; but, as
a rule, the more tools you have at your disposal the better
you can do your work. If you possess a tape-line, measure
the distance with it between the two tree-trunks. If you
have no tape but have a two-foot ruler, make yourself a
longer measure by marking off the feet and half-feet upon
a ten or twelve-foot pole, and use it to measure between
the trees. If, however, you have neither, use your legs
and pace the distance, and then cut two long, strong poles,
and see that they are long enough to span the distance between
the trees, leaving plenty of wood to project beyond
each tree. Flatten one side of each pole as shown in the
diagram B, B, Fig. 1. Next, select a sound log, a foot or so
in diameter, quarter it, and make four</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h3>A Blocks,</h3>

<p>each about two feet long. See A, A,
and A′, Fig. 1.</p>

<p>As it is best to have the bottom of
your house level, you must manage to
nail the A blocks the same distance
above the ground on each side of each
tree&mdash;that is, if the ground is level; if
not, you must allow for the slant of the
earth. Spike the blocks securely to the
trees with six-inch nails, using about
three nails to each block.</p>

<p>The foundation of the house may be
higher than your ladder will reach. In
this case cut two more poles
and four more blocks, and
at the point where the top
of your ladder reaches spike
on the blocks, and then rest</p>


<h3>The B Poles</h3>

<p>on them on each side of the two trees,
as in Fig. 1. Nail the B poles securely
to the tree, and with plank or half-round
sticks floor the space between the trees,
and you will have a good landing below
your house (see Fig. 5) from which a
ladder may be run to the proposed
foundation. After the upper rods have
been nailed to the trees and a ladder adjusted,
and for security nailed fast to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the tree and lower platform, you are ready to begin the
serious work of building. Take a good strong plank, two
inches thick, and cut two pieces about six feet long, and
shaped as shown by</p>


<h3>The Corbel Piece D</h3>

<p>in Fig. 2; then cut four struts (E, E, in Fig. 2) and two
king-posts (C, Fig. 2). Shave off the ends of the struts, as
shown in the diagram, to fit the notches cut in the corbel
pieces and the king-posts.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not necessary to spike this frame together&mdash;the
big nails might split the timber&mdash;they may be fastened together
slightly with wire nails and strengthened by a piece
of hoop-iron nailed on with small nails, as shown in Fig. 2<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at F, F, F, F, and this will keep the pieces from accidentally
slipping out of their bearings, or holes may be bored
and the parts held together with screws. The real strain
being an up-and-down thrust on the notches, the weight
will not bear upon the iron bands or screws. Great care
must be taken to make neat-fitting joints.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;A Two-Tree House.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>How to Build the Foundation.</h3>

<p>When the two pieces of the form of Fig. 2 are completed,
make fast a line to them and haul them up the tree;
then slip the ends of the rods B and B under the corbels D,
until the king-post C lies flat against the side of the tree-trunk.
Spike C securely to the tree-trunk, as shown in
Fig. 3; do the same with the other frame on the far side of
the other tree, and you have a firm foundation that will
hold more weight than you are liable to put upon it. Now
cut two more pieces of two-inch plank, say, ten feet long
by four inches broad; hoist them up and spike them to the
top of the corbel pieces D, D, so that they will project the
same distance beyond the tree at each end, as in Fig. 4.</p>

<p>From G to G you may now lay the planks of your floor,
if the distance is short: if not, put two poles across each
side of the trees and nail them to the trunks, and two more
across at each end of the pieces G, G, and nail them to G
and G, and then put your flooring on parallel to the G
planks.</p>


<h3>Frame, Walls, and Roof.</h3>

<p>The rest of the work is simple. To shed the rain your
roof must incline one way or the other&mdash;to the front, as in
Fig. 5, or to the back, as in the one-tree house, Fig. 6.
Nail on an A block to each tree, and give them the same
incline; then place two poles for rafters on the A blocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and nail them, each with a single nail, to the tree-trunk;
this will hold them in place until you cut four straight
poles for the uprights at the four corners of your house;
set these up under the ends of the rafters, and nail the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rafter to them and to the trees; then drive two or three
nails, slantingly, in the foot of the upright to secure them
to the floor (toe-nail, Fig. 92, Chap. IX.). A cross-piece on
top of the front and rear completes the skeleton of your
house, which may be roofed and the sides covered with
boards, or only the roof made of boards with narrow
strips over the cracks and the sides covered with poles,
by nailing the latter to the uprights as in Fig. 5. This
gives a fine rustic effect, but unless ceiled or boarded up
on the inside it will allow the wind and rain to beat
through.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="485" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Frame of a One-Tree House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the trees are further apart than desirable, the house
can be built between the trees, as in Fig. 5, but if the space
is no more than required, the house can be built so that the
sides enclose the tree-trunks, as the railing of the platform
does in Fig. 5.</p>


<h3>A Rustic House.</h3>

<p>It is really not necessary to use any plank or boards except
for the roof and floor. A boy who can handle an axe
and hatchet well can make the frame, Fig. 2, from timber
cut in the woods, but unless he is an expert, or can get
the services of an expert axeman, he had better use plank
as directed.</p>


<h3>The One-Tree House</h3>

<p>at first thought seems to be an even more serious problem
than the two-tree house, but a glance at Fig. 6 will show
how it can be built without much trouble.</p>

<p>First we nail the two A blocks on to the trunk, then the
two B sticks. After the two B sticks are placed upon the
A blocks and nailed to the tree, two more B poles must be
laid over the first at right angles to them, so as to enclose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the tree-trunk within a square of B sticks. Nail all four
sticks securely to the tree. You will notice that in this
case many of the sticks are notched near the ends, as D is
in Fig. 2, and for a similar purpose, to receive and hold the
ends of the struts, which are nailed at their lower ends
to the king-post (trunk
of the tree). It is unnecessary
to notch or
mar the trunk of the
tree, for the ends of the
struts are cut on an angle
to rest flat against
the trunk where they
are nailed, and the nails
will not injure the tree
in the least.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 shows the roof
boards laid clinker, or
lap-streak fashion, from
side to side. Where
a roof is laid in this
manner it is not necessary
or desirable to nail
strips over the cracks,
as these are fully protected
by the overlapping
boards.</p>

<p>Wherever it seems
necessary to add to the stability of the foundation of any of
the club-houses described, it can be done by struts from the
tree-trunk to the ends of the B sticks or other poles supporting
the structure.</p>

<p>equally applicable to a three or four branch foundation.
It is, of course, impossible for the writer to give exact
figures and iron-clad
rules for this style of
building, owing to the
variable nature and
growth of the trees,
but the most difficult
problems are here
solved, and any other
combination of trees
or branches will be
found to be only variations
of the ones
here illustrated and
described.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HUNTING WITHOUT A GUN.</span></h2>


<h3>How to Capture and Trap Small Live Animals.</h3>

<p>A boy who can spend part of his time out of town, and
is the fortunate owner of a mongrel cur, forms a combination
for enjoyment and fun hard to be beaten by anything
in nature. A good yellow dog, unencumbered by any aristocratic
ancestors, is an ideal companion in the wood, and
field: it can scent a woodchuck leagues away, it knows just
how to head a chipmonk off from its retreat, and there is
not a trick known to the professional poacher which is not
familiar to the real country plebeian cur.</p>


<h3>Chipmonks and Woodchucks!</h3>

<p>There is a potent charm in those words, which can iron
the wrinkles out of an old brow, and soften the hard lines in
the face of a careworn professional or business man.</p>

<p>Not long ago I attended a dinner given by the</p>


<h3>Camp-Fire Club,</h3>

<p>and there I found ranged around the table an array of veteran
hunters. There were men there who had hunted the
royal Bengal tiger in the jungles of India, men who had
fought with rogue elephants, men who had followed the
lions to their dens in Africa, men who had tracked the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
bear to its lair in the far frozen North. There were gentlemen
who hunted for pleasure, cowboys and scouts&mdash;Coquina
Shields, “Wolf” Thompson, “Curio” Brown, “Yellowstone”
Kelly, Andrew J. Stone, and many others equally
well-known in the forests or on the plains were seated at
the big round table.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>That they were real simon-pure sportsmen could be
seen at a glance, and yet, when the after-dinner speeches
were made, the sentiments which received the most enthusiastic
applause were those which <span class="smcap">DENOUNCED THE KILLING
OF MAN OR BEAST</span>. It could readily be seen that these men
only used the gun when it was necessary to procure food or
in self-defence. They all indorsed the use of the camera
for the hunt in place of the murderous gun; as one of them
remarked, “With a kodak every good shot is registered
with the click of the shutter, and an album of good shots is
a thing of which any man may be proud.”</p>

<p>With a little private zoo of captured live game you may
have a living album, which attests the skill of the collector
and his knowledge of woodcraft as accurately as any album
of photographs.</p>

<p>The next chapter tells how to build a back-yard zoo, and
now we must learn how to stock one. If the reader will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
examine the plans in the chapter mentioned, he will see that
there is one compartment marked</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="449" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Making a Capture.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>“Receiving-Cage.”</h3>

<p>This is the place where our new captures find temporary
shelter until their regular quarters are prepared for them.</p>

<p>The most accessible game for boys belongs to the</p>


<h3>Rodents or Gnawers.</h3>

<p>These animals can be readily distinguished by their long,
chisel-like front teeth. A familiar example of this family
may be found in every town and city, and is known as the
common rat, the Norway rat, or the brown rat.</p>

<p>Formerly the common rat of the United States was
black, but his brown relative has about exterminated the
more graceful black one. The only black rat I ever saw
was a dead one, which I found one summer in an unoccupied
house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. But there are
plenty of beautiful little gnawers around us everywhere.
There are the soft, furry, big-eyed flying-squirrels, which
leave their warm nests at dusk and sail through the air from
tree to tree, or romp among the branches until daylight.
Just at dawn they return to their beds, to sleep away the
day in their dark holes, secure from the garish sunlight.</p>

<p>Of course any boy with money can purchase flying-squirrels,
but no boy with any pride would stoop to buy his
live game, unless he is so unfortunate as to be unable to
leave the densely populated city. I well remember the two
boys<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who gave me my first lessons in hunting flying-squirrels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I followed them across meadows, over hills, through
the woods, down into the dank and dark swamps, until we
found some old hollow cedars on the edge of the water.
Here one of the lads armed himself with a small wand, and
the other busied himself gathering old dry leaves and bits
of moist bark to make a smudge. The boy armed with the
wand probed the hollow trees until he discovered a hole
from which the wand would bring forth some bits of the
fine shredded inner bark of the cedar.
We all know that neither the inner
bark nor any other
kind of bark grows
in the hollow of
trees, and when it is discovered
there you can wager that
it was put there by some animal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="450" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 9-11.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>This stringy, soft stuff is
famous material for a nest,
and both the white-footed
mice and the flying-squirrels
are fully aware of its good properties.</p>

<p>When some of this nesting is found in a tree, it is safe
to say that there is a nest inside.</p>


<h3>A Smudge</h3>

<p>is now lighted and the hollow tree is filled with smoke. As
soon as this is thoroughly done, you may safely thrust your
arm into the hollow and bring out the stupefied inmates.</p>

<p>I never knew the smoke to cause the squirrels any serious
harm. The little captives soon revive, when brought
out into the open air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>Flying-Squirrels,</h3>

<p>when tame, make the most gentle pets, but when wild, and
rudely seized by hand, they have a vicious way of using
their chisel-like teeth which induces more caution the next
time. A smoke-stupefied squirrel is much more pleasant to
handle than a wild one, frantic with fright.</p>

<p>If, however, you protect your hand with an ordinary
bicycle or golf cap, you can seize almost any small animal
with impunity. I caught nine flying-squirrels in one night,
with no protection for my hand but an old cloth cap.</p>

<p>Do not try to throw the cap over the animal, or it will
escape from beneath, but use the cap as a protection to
your hand, then grasp the creature by a quick movement,
closing your fingers tightly over its body, being careful not
to squeeze hard enough to injure the terrified little squirrel.
The advantage of this mode of capture is that, having the
game in your hand, you can easily thrust it into the cloth
bag you carry for that purpose.</p>


<h3>The Cloth Bag</h3>

<p>is a most convenient thing; it is easy to carry, allows plenty
of air, and the little creatures never think of gnawing out
while you carry them.</p>

<p>I have carried</p>


<h3>Short-Tailed Meadow-Rats</h3>

<p>and white-footed mice for miles, tied up in my handkerchief,
and no attempt was made by my prisoners to use
their teeth to assist them in escaping.</p>

<p>The gentle, graceful little jumping-mice, white-footed
mice, short-tailed meadow-rats, and flying squirrels are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to be found inside the city limits of Greater New York, and
some of their relatives are to be found in almost any rural
place in this country. These interesting little creatures can
be captured with ordinary box-traps, figure fours, or the
square or round wire mouse-traps. The white-footed mice
or deer-mice may be found in the abandoned nests of other
rodents, in hollow logs, in old corn-stacks, in holes in the
fence-rails, and under clods of old ploughed fields, or beneath
brush-heaps in the fence corners.</p>

<p>In the late autumn, before the first snow comes, they
have a very pretty way of</p>


<h3>Utilizing Last Summer’s Birds’-Nests</h3>

<p>by filling them with the soft down from the cat-tails of a
neighboring marsh, or with moss and wood fibres, thistledown,
or the silky feathers from the seed of the milk-weed.
Like flying-squirrels, the little deer-mice bury themselves
in the soft nests, and sleep away the day, emerging at
night for food and exercise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="300" height="181" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If the branch upon which the nest is located is but
touched, the brown-backed,
nimble-footed little squatter
will poke his head from the
middle of the nest, look inquiringly
around, and if no
danger appears the head is
withdrawn, and the mouse
resumes its slumbers; but if
it is deemed that there is
cause for serious alarm, it will
spring from the nest, and with the agility of a squirrel run
lightly up a branch, and from this point of vantage turn its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bright eyes on the intruder with a sort of “please don’t”
expression. If further frightened it will hastily leap to the
ground and disappear in the brush and dry leaves.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have found birds’-nests with a neatly laid
thatch roof over the bowl, and a round doorway gnawed
through the side of the nest for a means of access to the interior,
where, snugly curled up in a warm bed of down, the
little white-footed mouse was sleeping.</p>


<h3>White-Footed Mice as Pets.</h3>

<p>Once, while skating on a pond, I discovered a pair of
deer-mice keeping house in the walls of the mound of mud
and roots reared by musk-rats for their winter quarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12A.</span>&mdash;The Old Figure-Four Trap.&mdash;Any old box will do for a figure-four trap;
but much trouble is avoided by using a box with a large lid for live game, as shown
in Fig. 12. This is set upside down, as shown above. The lid is considerably larger
than the box, and attached to it by a couple of leather hinges which are tacked to
the lid and the box, as shown in the illustration. Fig. 9 is the spindle or trigger, and
shows the manner in which the notches are cut. Fig. 10 is the catch, and Fig. 11 is
the upright. In Fig. 12A you see this old-fashioned trap, set and ready for business.
A small door in the box will make it easy to remove captives.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>You may capture these little fellows by hand, if you use
due caution in approaching their habitation, and shield
your hand with an ordinary pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>They will make beautiful pets, and you will find them
much more interesting than the common white mice.</p>

<p>Give them a tall narrow cage, with plenty of head room,
wire a branch containing a last summer’s bird’s-nest to the
side of their cage for sleeping quarters, and feed the mice
with bread, seed, and grain.</p>


<h3>Short-tailed Meadow-Rats</h3>

<p>frequent the salt meadows, where their grass-roofed paths
may be found intersecting each other everywhere. After
the blunt-headed little creatures have been discovered, by
uncovering their runways, you may capture them with your
hand, shielded by a cloth cap.</p>

<p>Beware of their teeth, for they are savage biters and
plucky fighters.</p>

<p>Meadow-rats are not climbers. Put them in a flat cage
with a good wide expanse of bottom covered with sod of
growing grass, the roots of which they will eagerly devour.
Feed them garden vegetables, when grass roots are not
available.</p>

<p>If you are an expert it is sometimes possible to catch
chipmonks by hand. I never succeeded but once in capturing
one in this manner. They will enter almost any ordinary
sort of a trap, and can be best captured in that way. Set
the trap near the hole known to be occupied by one of
these scolding little rodents, and give your captives a roomy
cage, with a dark corner for a nest. They make gentle and
amusing pets. Feed them on acorns and nuts. Crack the
hardest nuts for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3>Jumping-mice,</h3>

<p>when discovered, are off like a flash, and are too swift of
foot to be captured by hand&mdash;at least this has been my experience.
They may sometimes be found under clods of an
old ploughed field, in fence corners, or under loose brush
and stones. Like the white-footed mice and flying-squirrels,
they are nocturnal in their habits, and there may be
thousands living all around you, and you will never suspect
their presence until your cat brings one in from the field,
or you find their half-devoured remains in the screech-owl’s
nest in the old apple-tree.</p>

<p>Jumping-mice have been known to make their nests in a
beehive, and I know of one short-tailed meadow-rat which
chose the same sort of sweet home.</p>

<p>In winter the jumping-mouse becomes torpid and apparently
dead, and you may lay him away in a box of cotton,
where it will remain until the bursting bud and freshening
grass announce the approach of spring. Then your little
pet will wake up, and be as full of life as if it had only taken
a noon nap.</p>

<p>Although quite vicious, and dangerous to handle in their
wild state,</p>


<h3>Woodchucks</h3>

<p>make very gentle and comical pets. One celebrated woodchuck-hunter
had great success by using a stuffed woodchuck
as a decoy. A very good substitute for a stuffed
animal may be made of gray Canton flannel, stuffed with
cotton.</p>

<p>Set your decoy up in plain view of the woodchuck’s hole,
and sprinkle fresh clover around. Then conceal yourself
behind the hole, and be ready with a strong ring-net on a
pole to capture your game when it appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The watchful old fellow will see the decoy sitting on
its haunches, and reasoning that where it is safe for one
“chuck” it is safe for another, he will sally forth to enjoy
the clover. Then the fun begins. You must jump between
the woodchuck and his hole, and net him as best you can,
after which transfer him to a meal-bag, and carry him to
his cage.</p>

C, and another near the rear end of the trigger, in which the bevelled edges of the
catch are caught and held in place by the string attached to the trap-door. Fig.
<span class="nowrap">13 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> shows the details of Fig. 13. The box-trap is an old “stand-by” with the
boys, is simple in construction, and can be made by any lad who can handle tools.
This drawing was made from a trap built by a country lad, twelve years of age. A
serviceable trap can be improvised from an old tin can, or, better still, one of those
square tin boxes used so generally now for holding fancy groceries.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Woodchucks can run rapidly for eight or ten yards; then
they have a habit of suddenly coming to a stop, assuming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
their favorite upright pose, and darting off again in another
direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="600" height="477" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Tin Can-Trap.&mdash;Make a door of a square or rectangular piece of tin. With a
nail make two holes in the top of the door for the wire hinges (Fig. 14). With a
heavy knife cut a doorway a trifle smaller than the door. Cut three slashes as
shown in Fig. 15. Bend the two sides in as shown in Fig. 16, then hang the door
with the wire hinges. Fig. 17 shows the door from the inside of the tin box, and
Fig. 18 shows the same from the outside. The door, as may be readily seen, can
be pushed up from the outside to admit the game, but when the prisoners attempt
to get out they cannot push the door open, for the trap opens but one way. Do not
leave space enough below the side-pieces for the animal to thrust his nose or paws
under, or it may lift the door in this way and escape. If, as in the diagrams, it is
necessary to cut a little above the bottom of the box, put a flat stone, or some similar
object, inside for the side-pieces and the door to rest upon. Fig. 19 shows the
manner of cutting the tin. Another door can be made by cutting a star in the tin,
and then bending the pointed pieces in far enough to allow the game to squeeze
through. The points will not allow anything to crawl out, however, and it must remain
there until released (Fig. 20). These diagrams are given so that the young
hunters may make their own traps, in case the ordinary mice and rat-traps to be
found in shops are inaccessible.</p></div>

<p>June is the time to capture the young ones, as they play
about their home hole.</p>

<h3>A Box-Trap, or Figure Four,</h3>

<p>may be successfully used to capture both young and old.</p>

<p>However fierce an old wild “ground-hog” may be, one
that is taken young and reared in captivity is remarkably
gentle. It is fond of a noonday nap, but when the sun
sinks in the west, and the long shadows creep across the
fields, it will rouse from its slumber, sit up, wash its face
like a mouse or a squirrel, and be ready for a frolic.</p>

</div>

<p>When cold weather approaches, the woodchuck, ground-hog,
marmot, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">siffleur</i>, as it is variously called, will prepare
for a long winter sleep by rolling itself into a ball. In
this condition you may pack
it away like the jumping-mouse,
and when friends call
you can take the ground-hog
out and even roll it around
the floor without seeing any
signs of life displayed by
the hairy ball. But when
spring returns, your Rip
Van Winkle pet will awaken,
and after sitting up on
its haunches, and washing its face with its front paws, will
be ready for a breakfast of clover or other food.</p>

<p>Rare old Captain John Smith, in his quaint “History of
New England and the Summer Isles,” published in London
in 1624, gives, probably, the first written account of the
musk-rat. He says that “the mussascus is a beast of the
form and nature of our (English) water-rat;” and he adds,
“some of them smell exceedingly strong of musk.” These
animals may be caught in almost any sort of a trap baited
with sweet apples or parsnips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>Musk-Rats</h3>

<p>have very strong teeth, and can use them on wood effectively,
so it is wise to protect all corners and cracks in your
wooden traps with pieces of tin or sheet-iron. They have
good noses, and can smell an apple a long distance off. Place
your traps in the shallow water at the edge of the mill-pond
or stream inhabited by these rats, and they will doubtless
find it without difficulty.</p>

<p>Young musk-rats are very gentle and playful, and may
be handled without fear; they do not grow fierce with age
if reared in captivity and accustomed to gentle treatment.</p>

</div>

<p>When kept in confinement
give them a roomy
cage, with a tank of water
to swim in. Build the tank
after the manner of the one
described in the “Back-yard
Fish-Pond.”</p>

<p>There is one other little
animal, familiar to most boys, and which they are too apt to
value only for its skin. In truth, this creature generally has
a very bad name, and, personally, I owe it a grudge for
stealing all my live bait, on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when domesticated and supplied with
plenty of food, like many a poor two-legged wretch, it will
turn honest, and give up its bad habit of robbing hen-roosts.
This long-bodied little animal is the mink, which, like those
animals already described, is not difficult to capture in
almost any sort of a trap.</p>

<p>When caught young it becomes very gentle, and even
affectionate. It is passionately fond of frogs, and these
batrachians make a good bait for mink-traps. Minks will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
eat fish and when domesticated will not hurt your chickens,
but will wage a relentless war upon rats and mice.</p>

<p>You need not confine your mink, for it will make chums
of your dog and cat, and is fond of a cosey spot in the
chimney corner.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Turtle-Trap.&mdash;This is simply a box with a door, like Fig. 10. The trap is
set in shallow water, and baited with meat. It is very effective.</p></div>

<p>While I was sketching on the coast of Maine I spent a
whole day at my easel, between two great rocks. I soon
discovered that I was watched by some creatures, and it
was not long before my neighbors made up their minds that
the two-legged thing was a harmless sort of animal, and,
before I finished my sketch, they amused themselves by
jumping back and forth over my feet. At first I was more
afraid of them than they were of me, but soon discovered
that they meant no harm: so I painted away, with a pair of
wild mink playing about my feet like tame kittens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="titlefont">THE BACK-YARD ZOO.</span></h2>


<p>The king of beasts and the royal Bengal tiger are neither
of them able to inspire such universal terror among the wild
creatures of the forest as does man.</p>

<p>Bitter experience and terrible examples of man’s ferocious
cruelty to all wild animals have taught even the most
humble and inoffensive of them to dread the approach of
the bloodthirsty two-legged destroyer.</p>

<p>It is high time that we redeem</p>


<h3>Our Reputation among the Brutes.</h3>

<p>It is time we ceased our wasteful, senseless slaughter of
every wild thing to be met with in field and forest. It is
time we began to study live animals, in place of uncanny
dried skins and badly upholstered “specimens,” so-called.</p>


<h3>This Gory Method of Study</h3>

<p>belongs to the past. A new era has commenced, and real
naturalists now drop their dry bones and moth-eaten skins
to enjoy the study of live, healthy animals.</p>

<p>The boy who is really fond of animals never ill-treats his
pets, or abuses and makes a slave of his dog. On the contrary,
his dog is his companion and playmate.</p>

<p>The boy knows that a dog’s master is a god in the eyes
of the poor brute, and is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3>Worshipped with Canine Devotion,</h3>

<p>which again and again has been proved faithful unto death.
Such knowledge makes the boy just and kind. But a dog
is only a domesticated wolf, and the wolf is not the only
wild creature which can be domesticated; neither is the
wolf the only animal which</p>


<h3>Can Appreciate Kindness.</h3>

<p>The same care which transforms a red-mouthed wolf into
a faithful dog can transform other undomesticated beasts
into useful creatures. As soon as an animal learns that you
are contributing to its comfort, you may notice it will greet
you with a milder expression. As soon as you can make the
wildest and fiercest beast understand that the use of jaws,
claws, or sting is unnecessary, it will refrain from using
them. It is not always possible to come to this understanding
with the larger beasts, and such animals are not fitted
for back-yard zoos.</p>

<p>A lad who loves his pets will bestow upon the little
creatures that affection which shows itself in a sympathy
which can understand their wants and necessities. Such a
lad can perform wonders; birds will come at his call, the
small beasts of the field will follow at his heels, and no child
will fear him.</p>

</div>

<p>Unfortunately, in spite of the amount of land on this
continent, it is difficult for any but the very wealthy to have
access to much of it, hence many readers will say, “We have
no yard in which to keep pets,” or, “Our yard is too small.”
Of course, if you are living in a flat you must go without a
zoo, but if you have a yard it will probably not be less than
twenty-five feet wide, and Fig. 22 shows how a very comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
zoo can be placed in the rear of a twenty-five
foot lot, without materially interfering with such domestic
matters as the drying of clothes on wash-day. A city</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="600" height="529" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Arrangement of Dens in the
Back-yard.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Lot Twenty-five Feet Wide</h3>

<p>is usually one hundred feet deep; this will
allow plenty of room for the house and the
clothes-lines, and still leave the end of the
lot for a famous back-yard zoölogical garden.</p>

<p>When the writer was building back-yard
zoos on the banks of the muddy Licking
River, in old Kentucky, wire-cloth and wire-netting
were unknown, and a few old barrels
and dry-goods boxes, a saw, hatchet, and
some nails, constituted the materials and
tools with which he and his playmates made cages for
pets, frog-ponds, and dove-cots.</p>

<p>The writer’s</p>


<h3>Crow and Dog did the Bossing</h3>

<p>of the work, and incidentally learned all the weak spots in the
structures, a knowledge which they were not slow to use
when the sheds and coops were finished, and occupied by
creatures fascinatingly interesting to crows and dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>But you boys are lucky fellows! Everything that youth
wants is now on the market at reasonable prices. Wire-cloth
and galvanized wire-netting with double-twisted
selvages, with meshes of any size to suit the occasion, and
wire of any dimensions to suit the purpose, are now manufactured
especially for the building of cages.</p>


<h3>Galvanized Iron Wire-Cloth or Netting</h3>

<p>comes in rolls, with either square or hexagonal mesh; in
other words, the openings between the wires are in the form
of a square, or are six-sided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="300" height="176" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Temporary Frame of Cage.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wire is numbered from the very heavy, No. 000, which
is over a third of an inch in
diameter, to No. 40, which
is only .00725 of an inch in
diameter. It is not very
likely that you will use
either of these wires, unless
your collection includes
some very large
and strong beasts and
some very small insects.
The wires which you will probably need will be between
No. 14 and No. 22. No. 14 is eighth-tenths of an inch in
diameter, and No. 22 is a little more than two-tenths of an
inch in diameter.</p>


<h3>The Mesh</h3>

<p>is the distance from <em>centre to centre</em> of the wire. No. 5 mesh
means five meshes to the lineal inch&mdash;that is, a piece of netting
five inches long will contain twenty-five meshes. The
“space” means the opening between the wires&mdash;that is, the
distance from <em>wire to wire</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>This is explained because some of the readers may not
live near any dealer in wire-goods, and will be compelled to
order what they want by letter. To do this intelligently
they should understand the trade terms. Galvanized wire-netting,
used for small bird-cages, comes in one-half, five-eighth
and three-quarter-inch mesh, and is made of from
No. 18 to No. 22 wire. The width of this netting varies
from two feet to four feet. One-and-one-quarter-inch mesh
is used for pigeon-houses, and the netting is from two feet
to six feet wide. One-inch mesh is used for quail, ruffed
grouse, pheasants, prairie-chickens, etc. A two-inch mesh
is usually used for chicken-coops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="300" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 24 and 25.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a rule, the mesh which has square spaces is called
wire-cloth, and that which has six-sided spaces is called
netting. For mice, rats, chipmonks,
flying-squirrels, gray
and red squirrels, use about
No. <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> square mesh of No.
17 galvanized wire.</p>

<p>For woodchucks and
musk-rats use a rather small
mesh and pretty heavy wire,
for their teeth are strong
chisels, and you will be surprised
to see what skilled
mechanics they are in the
use of the tools with which
nature has supplied them.
For rabbits, a two-inch mesh
or any of the nettings used
for poultry answers all purposes; but for foxes, if you use a
two-inch mesh, be careful to have it of heavy wire. The
writer’s Skye terrier pup gnawed its way through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
chicken-coop wire-netting on various occasions, and a fox
has all the energy of a terrier, coupled with a most surprising
amount of ingenuity and skill in jail-breaking.</p>


<h3>A Pair of Foxes</h3>

<p>I once owned could undo any knot or catch that I
could invent with which to fasten them, and I was only
made aware of the fact from the complaints of lost chickens
which came from our neighbors.</p>

<p>While the neighbors were protesting, Faust and Mrs.
Faust lay in front of their den, staring innocently at us
with their great brown eyes, but investigation proved that
the chains which apparently confined them were attached
to nothing but their collars; and, furthermore, when I
pushed the foxes aside with my foot, sundry quills and
feathers, protruding from the fresh earth of their bed,
showed only too plainly that our neighbors were not without
reason in suspecting my innocent-looking rascally
pets. I at last solved the problem by chaining the foxes
together, and in spite of all their cunning, they never
learned to go through the same opening in the fence, but
each chose a different exit, and both were then held by
their chain.</p>


<h3>Each Cage</h3>

<p>the reader makes will, of necessity, be of a form peculiar to
his purpose and the location where it is placed. If it is for
a fence-corner there will be but two sides to cover with
wire-netting; if it be against the fence there will be three
sides of netting: the fence forming the other side. In a
hundred different ways will the surroundings modify the
form of the cages, so, to simplify matters, we will suppose
the proposed pen is to stand in the centre of the yard. In
this case,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3>To Make a Cage of Galvanized Wire-Netting,</h3>

<p>you first decide upon the wire and the mesh which are
needed for this particular coop, next decide what are to be
the dimensions; then, with a hand-saw, cut four wooden
uprights exactly the same length, and fasten these posts
together, temporarily, as shown in Fig. 23, A, B, C, D.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="450" height="340" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Cages and Runway.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The strips connecting the uprights, and forming a box-like
frame, should be only secure enough to keep the frame
in shape. The nails in
the strips must be driven
just far enough to
hold, leaving the head
and enough of each nail
above-board to render it
a simple task to withdraw
the nails when
you wish to remove the
strips.</p>

<p>When the temporary
frame or mould is finished
(Fig. 23), fasten
the end of the wire-netting
securely to the front of the upright A with staple tacks,
then pass the roll to B (Fig. 24), draw it tight, and with
more staple tacks secure it to this upright; continue the
same process at C and D, ending at A, as shown in Fig. 24.
The arrows show the direction to be observed in passing
the netting around the uprights.</p>

<p>When all is snug and fastened firmly, nail a footboard
and top moulding on, as shown in Fig. 25, after which remove
the temporary inside strips, and your coop is done.
It has no roof or floor as yet, but the roof can be made of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wood or netting, as the occasion may require; the floor
may be of wood or earth, to suit the purposes for which it
is to be used. In large cages the doors must be framed
and set in, as shown in the picture of fox-dens in the illustration
of the back-yard zoo, but in small cages a small hole
may be cut in the netting&mdash;this can be done with an old
pair of shears. The square piece of netting from the cut
can then be used as a door by fastening one edge with loops
of wire to the edge of the opening just made. Picture-wire
and copper wire are best for such purpose, because they
are pliable and easily handled.</p>


<h3>The Door</h3>

<p>can, if desired, be made very neat by the following method:
Cut some tin into strips of the proper dimensions, then fold
the strips on their centre, lengthwise. Punch a series of
holes by placing the folded strips of tin on a block of wood
and driving a nail through. Slip the folded tin over the
exposed edges of the wire-netting, and sew it in place by
threading a fine wire through the holes. Bind the edges of
the door in the same manner, then put a loop of wire on the
door for a hasp, and a smaller one on the cage near the edge
of the doorway for a staple, and the door may be fastened
with a peg of wood or a nail; or, better still, wire a hook on
the door in place of a hasp, and arrange it so as to hook
into the loop on the cage.</p>

<p>It is often handy to have doors in the roof of a cage, as
in the roofs of the gnawers’ cages, over the rabbit runway,
in the illustration.</p>


<h3>The Doors for the Runway</h3>

<p>to the rabbit-house are on top, and open like a door to a
bin, as shown in the illustration and in Fig. 26. While we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
are at the rodents’, or gnawers’, quarters, it is well to remember
certain peculiarities about the habits of these animals.
Rats, mice, squirrels, and their kind, will invariably
seek a crack, angle or corner to commence work for a hole;
knowing this, it is well to protect all such places by pieces
of metal or tin, and none of the little fellows will make his
escape, unless the door is left open.</p>

<p>Rabbits will seldom gnaw out, but if they have an opportunity
they will tunnel out.</p>

<p>To prevent diggers from escaping, allow your wire-netting
to extend a foot and a half underground, below the footboard.</p>


<h3>A Reptile House</h3>

<p>need not be more than three feet high. It is not shown in
the illustration, but may be built as described and shown in
Figs. 23, 24, and 25, after which a roof of wire-cloth must be
added.</p>

<p>Into this house you put your turtles, frogs, toads, lizards,
and snakes, and as most, if not all, of these require
water in considerable quantity, it is well to have a tank for
their use. But as every boy does not know how to build
the tank, he may learn by following the directions in the
following chapter, describing a back-yard fish-pond.</p>

<p>Be careful to set the tank level and pack it around with
good hard earth. It is well to sod the ground on three
sides, and cover the earth on the remaining side with clean
sand and gravel.</p>

<p>There should be a strip of land at least two feet wide
all around the tank, as a runway. When this is all arranged
spread a layer of sand all over the bottom of the
tank, fill it with water, and place the cage over all. You
should have</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>An Old Piece of Canvas,</h3>

<p>or some similar covering, for the cage, to be used when
your sand is in danger of being washed away by a downpour
of rain.</p>

<p>Everything is now ready, and you can turn loose in the
enclosure</p>


<h3>Your Whole Collection</h3>

<p>of frogs, toads, lizards, and snakes, and they will soon
make themselves at home. You must not be surprised if
your pets in this cage feed upon one another. I once
owned an old bull-frog who would attempt to swallow anything
that moved, with the exception of snakes. This frog
swallowed two live mice in one day, but he did not get
hungry again for two weeks.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>There are but few poisonous snakes in our country, and
in the Northern States we have but two kinds&mdash;copperheads
and rattlesnakes. Neither of these will add to the interest
of your collection, and must be left out and let alone.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>There are many beautiful and harmless little snakes to
be found in every field. They abound within the city limits
of New York.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I saw two sunning themselves on a
neighbor’s lawn, and discovered their home in the gate-post.</p>

<p>You will be surprised at the many varieties of frogs you
can find when you start to collect these comical little creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Some of them are very difficult to catch, and they
often turn up in the oddest of places. I found a big toad
in the top of a tree which I had climbed after young crows.
It was a common hop-toad, not a tree-frog.</p>


<h3>Silly Superstitions of Hoop-Snake Age.</h3>

<p>It is high time that the American boys, in the dawn of
the twentieth century, should forget all the fabulous stories
of snakes with the power to “charm” persons, toads with
death-dealing breath, deadly swifts and venomous lizards.
All such yarns are handed down to us by our superstitious
ancestors, and are a part of the witch belief of the old Salem
folk. There are people living now who will tell you that
they have seen a hoop-snake with his tail in his mouth, rolling
down hill, and these people really believe what they say;
but so did the Salem folks believe in witches.</p>

<h3>Toads: Useful and Harmless.</h3>

<p>If our comical, insect-destroying toads were venomous,
the hand which pens these lines would have perished while
it was still a chubby, dimpled, baby’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h3>Neither Do Toads Make Warts;</h3>

<p>otherwise the writer’s hands would be far too warty to
wield either a pen or a brush; but in spite of the hundreds
of toads handled by the writer he never was afflicted with
warts on either hands or body.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania there is a toad which has occupied the
same back-dooryard for over ten years, and he will eat his
own weight in “bugs” in a very short time.</p>

<p>The funniest toad ever owned by the writer was a Kentucky
hop-toad with five well-developed legs, and the
largest frog the writer ever caught was a New York bull-frog,
which weighed one pound.</p>


<h3>Frog Market.</h3>

<p>St. Paul and Minneapolis are the great frog markets of
the world. The receipts there last year, according to the
daily papers, were something over six million frogs!</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of New York City one of the
earliest frogs is the little brown cricket-frog. Next come
the mysterious and shrill-voiced peepers, which make each
marshy spot fairly shriek with their high-keyed notes.</p>


<h3>Peepers</h3>

<p>are hard to capture, because you can seldom see them. A
dip-net run through the water where you have heard peepers
will generally reward you with two or three little dusky
imps, who, when captured, will sing in your coat-pocket,
and the writer has had them sing while imprisoned in his
hands.</p>

<p>A loud, coarse trill announces the appearance of</p>

<h3>The Tree-Toad,</h3>

<p>and this batrachian makes a most interesting addition to the
collection. It is said that the tree-toad has the power of
changing color, varying from ash-white, dull-gray or a
brown to a bright-green hue.</p>

<p>You must look for the hermit-frogs or spade-frogs where
they hide in holes in the ground, and in the damp wood
you can hunt the lean-flanked, beautifully-spotted leopard-frog,
his cousin, the pickerel-frog, and the brown wood-frog.</p>

<p>The bright-green-tree specimen, known as</p>


<h3>The Anderson Frog,</h3>

<p>is considered by frog-hunters as a great prize, and specimens
can only be captured at rare intervals. When you
secure a rare frog do not put him in the same place with
larger frogs, for the latter will swallow their smaller companions
the first time they feel hungry.</p>


<h3>The Frog Has Teeth.</h3>

<p>Put your finger in a frog’s mouth and you can distinctly
feel a number of fine, sharp teeth, but if you put your finger
in a toad’s mouth you will find no teeth; a frog grabs his
prey with his jaws, a toad snips it up with his tongue.</p>

<p>Besides the common, funny old hop-toad, there are the
Rocky Mountain hop-toads, the Southern hop-toads, and the
hop-toads from Northeastern Massachusetts, which differ
sufficiently from the common hop-toad to be classed by
naturalists as sub-species.</p>


<h3>Lizards.</h3>

<p>With the exception of the Gila Monster <em>there are no poisonous
lizards known</em>, and although many of the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
creatures will try to bite you, their teeth are as harmless
as so many needle points, and cannot be felt through a
glove. Put on an old glove when handling them and you
can hold them better; but be very careful and not be rude,
or you may be surprised to find you have a stump-tailed
lizard in your hand while the caudal appendage will be
twisting around in a most astonishing manner at your feet.</p>

<p>Many beautiful and interesting lizards may be captured
in all parts of the Union.</p>

<p>That it is not cruel to capture and confine wild animals
is proved by the fact that almost all wild creatures, after
they have become thoroughly familiar with their quarters,
will not voluntarily leave their artificial homes for any protracted
period. I have had wild pigeons return after giving
them their freedom, and have had foxes return after securing
their own freedom, by skill and cunning superior to
that exercised by me in confining them. As for crows,
coons, squirrels, and numerous other creatures possessed
by me at different times, only death or forcible detention
ever prevented them from returning to the place where
plenty of food and kindness awaited them.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, or even desirable, to build all your
cages at one time, for it is hardly possible that you will
know just what you need until you have secured the creatures
you wish to keep confined in the proposed pens and
enclosures.</p>


<h3>The Receiving-Cage.</h3>

<p>Allow your cages to grow naturally, by adding additions
or new ones as the occasion requires. Acting upon this
plan the receiving-cage will be the first to be erected, and
it should be strong enough to securely confine the largest
of your captives, while the mesh of the wire-cloth should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be fine enough to prevent the escape of the smallest pocket-mouse.
The angles and corners should be well protected
with metal, to resist the teeth of the gnawers, and the bottom
protected with wire-cloth, to defeat the attempts of the
diggers.</p>

<p>This cage will, at different times, furnish lodging for all
the varieties of beasts or birds which are from time to
time included in your ever-growing collection. Your new
animals are first put in the receiving-cage, and must live
there until suitable quarters are built for them.</p>


<h3>The Value of Room.</h3>

<p>Build all your cages as roomy as your available space
and material will allow, and study to make their interiors
as like the natural haunts of the imprisoned animals as is
practicable. Avoid all attempts at ornamenting the cages,
for no cage looks better and more artistic than the strictly
practical one, built solely with a view to usefulness.</p>

<p>Clean sand will be found very useful for spreading over
the floors of the wooden-bottomed cages, and a large box
of it, kept in a dry place, will add greatly to your ability to
keep things tidy.</p>

<p>Be particular about the nesting of your mice and squirrels;
frequently remove the old nests and burn them, at the
same time supplying the little creatures with a fresh lot of
clean cotton, wool, fine grass, or even paper, and they will
arrange a new bed for themselves out of the fresh material.</p>

<p>You will soon discover that all beasts prefer to keep
clean, and have methods of their own by which they endeavor
to keep themselves neat and presentable, without the
use of soap. Any disagreeable odor proceeding from their
cages simply means neglect on the part of the keeper of the
zoo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A BACK-YARD FISH-POND.</span></h2>


<p>Although the writer has made frequent journeys to
the wonderful dreamland of his boyhood, and has ruthlessly
taken and brought to earth many of its air-castles for
the use of the boys of the present day, there are still a number
of things left, and among the latter is the back-yard fish-pond,
which we shall now seize, and, bringing the idea down
to your back-yard, make it water-tight, so that you can
stock it with real live fish.</p>


<h3>A Shallow Pond,</h3>

<p>with a broad surface exposed to the air will support, in
health many more inhabitants than a deep hole, with small
exposed surface. Remember that it is easier to keep a fish
alive in a shallow basin than it is in a bottle holding exactly
the same amount of water.</p>


<h3>If You Dig a Hole</h3>

<p>in your yard and fill it with water, it will be a mud-hole, in
which no self-respecting fish will live: besides which the
soil will soon soak up the water and leave the mud to bake
in the hot summer sun.</p>


<h3>By Sinking a Wooden Tank</h3>

<p>in the ground and filling it with water a pond may be made.
But any old box will not answer, for, unless you are a much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
better mechanic than the writer was at your age, you will
not be able to prevent an ordinary box from leaking.</p>

<p>However, if you really want a back-yard fish-pond, you
may make a box or tank which will hold water, and the</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="456" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Back-yard Fish Pond.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Best Form for Such a Tank</h3>

<p>is that of a wide, flat-bottomed scow. This scow may be of
any dimensions you choose to build it, but I would advise
you to make your first one not more than six feet long by
four feet wide, and two feet deep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 27</span> and <span class="smcap">28</span>.&mdash;The Side-boards must be Duplicates.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In selecting lumber for the scow, pick out pieces which
are comparatively free from knots or blemishes. Reserve
two one-and-a-half-inch planks, and keep the half-inch boards
for the bottom.</p>

<p>A saw, a plane, and a sharp hatchet are necessary, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
other tools, if not absolutely needed, should not on that
account be ignored, as they may come in very handy at
times.</p>

<p>Trim off your two side-boards to exactly the same
length&mdash;say six feet; they should then be six feet by two
feet. On the edge which is to be the bottom measure toward
the centre from each end of each board two feet, and
mark the points; then rule a line diagonally from each of
these points to the corners of the boards on the upper
edge; this will mark out a sort of double-ended sled-runner,
as shown in the illustrations, and when you saw off the triangular
pieces marked on the boards you will have</p>


<h3>Two Runners.</h3>

<p>Set these runners side to side, on their long edges, and
round off the angles with your plane, until the boards look
like rockers (see Fig. 27). The side-boards must be exact
duplicates of each other (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>Set the two side-pieces four feet apart and nail two or
three temporary cross-pieces across their top (longest) edges
to hold them in position; then turn them over and nail on
the bottom-boards (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>You must use the greatest care in fitting the bottom-boards
edge to edge, but you need not trouble yourself
about the ends of the boards; allow them to project upon
each side, as chance may direct. After the boards are all
securely nailed to the bottom the ends may be sawed off
flush with the sides of the scow (Fig. 29).</p>


<h3>To Prevent the Wood from Decay</h3>

<p>it is well to melt some tar over a fire, and, with a small mop
made of rags tied to the end of a stick, paint the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the scow with hot tar, being careful to see that all the
cracks and crevices are thoroughly filled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;The Ends may be Sawed off Flush.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>In the Shadiest Spot</h3>

<p>you can find in the back-yard dig a hole for your tank.
Make the bottom level. Set your tank in place and pack
the earth well around the edges. Cover the bottom of the
pond with about one inch depth of sand, and the surface of
the sand with a coating of gravel; then carefully fill the
tank, without disturbing the sand, and allow the water to
settle; after which a few aquatic plants may be introduced
and a wire fence built around the pond to keep out intruders
of the two-footed and four-footed kind. If you
have a few small frogs and turtles the mesh of the wire in
the fence must be small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3>When to Stock.</h3>

<p>After the water has stood for three or four days, and the
aquatic plants have started to grow in their new quarters,
you can stock the pond with sunfish, rock-bass, dace, small
catfish, crawfish, carp, and goldfish. The two last-named
are the most stupid of the fish, and the rock-bass is one of
the most intelligent fish I have ever kept in captivity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="600" height="197" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Cross-Section of Tank.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Handy for the Pets.</h3>

<p>The inclined ends of the scow-shaped tank give two
sloping shores (Fig. 30), which will be appreciated by the
crawfish, turtles, and frogs; and if you build a little rockery
in the centre the more timid fish will thank you for your
thoughtfulness in providing them a safe retreat.</p>

<p>If it is possible for you to</p>


<h3>Catch Your Own Fish</h3>

<p>do not waste your money buying stupid goldfish. The fun
of hunting for other small fish, capturing them and taming
them, is more than half the pay for the work, in the pleasure
it will afford you. However, if you are so situated that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
you cannot go fishing yourself, the aquarium stores in the
big cities will supply you with almost any sort of aquatic
creature.</p>


<h3>Fresh-Water Clams</h3>

<p>or mussels will live in confinement, and a few make an interesting
addition to a collection. Water-snails act as
scavengers for the under-water settlement, and a handful
of them may be added to form a sort of street-cleaning department.
Caddice worms and the little fresh-water shrimp
which you find among the water-plants make excellent food
for your fish.</p>


<h3>Avoid Salt-Water Sand,</h3>

<p>stones, and shells, for the salts they contain are injurious to
fresh-water creatures. Do not change the water in the
tank after it is in running order; but as it evaporates replenish
with fresh water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="titlefont">PIGEON-LOFTS AND BANTAM-COOPS.</span></h2>


<p>The best place in the world for boys is out-doors, breathing
good fresh air, and the best place in the world for
pigeons and chickens is out-doors, breathing good fresh air.
Our modern environments too often limit the amount of
out-door space which boys can occupy, and also limit the
supply of fresh air they can furnish their pets.</p>

<p>In making designs for the latter we must take into consideration
the limited space of a city back-yard, as well as
the fact that during the extreme cold weather pigeons,
chickens, and boys, all need some warm retreat where they
may roost or sleep.</p>

<p>Indeed, chickens really</p>


<h3>Need Shelter</h3>

<p>more than either boys or pigeons; the former have been
known to thrive and grow lusty and strong when living like
the wild animals of the forests, and every boy knows of
some location where pigeons have taken up their abode
with no better shelter than that afforded by an open shed,
or the overhanging eaves of a house.</p>


<h3>Chickens,</h3>

<p>coming originally from tropical woods, will thrive better
where their delicate combs and toes are not liable to be
frost-bitten, and one is more certain not to lose his fantails,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pouters, ruff-necks, tumblers, and homing pigeons, if he has
a suitable loft in which to confine his pets. These considerations
lead to the designing of a combined pigeon-house
and bantam-coop suitable for the limited space of the diminutive
city back-yards, or even appropriate for the roof of a
rear extension, where there is no back-yard to the dwelling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="600" height="437" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Frame of Bantam-Coop and Pigeon-Loft.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By referring to Fig. 31 you will see two boys at work
upon the frame of</p>


<h3>A Pigeon-Loft and Bantam-Coop</h3>

<p>which is capable of holding with comfort enough pets to
gladden the heart of any healthy boy.</p>

<p>The longest posts, A G and B H, are supposed to be
about nine or ten feet high and nailed fast to the back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fence. The dotted line, which cuts the frame in half, is to
show that a building half the size of the one in the drawing
will be plenty large enough for quite commodious quarters
for the birds. After the frame has been nailed together
and the protruding ends of the timbers all sawed off even
with the rest of the frame, a floor must be laid to the pigeon-loft
and securely nailed in place.</p>


<h3>Rough Lumber Will Answer.</h3>

<p>It is not even necessary to have smoothed lumber for
the flooring or any part of the house, but matched and
planed boards will make a much neater piece of work.
The uprights and all the frame are supposed to be built of
“two-by-four” (two inches thick by four inches wide), but
even this is not necessary, and in the country, where trimmed
lumber is scarce, the whole frame may be built of poles cut
in the woods.</p>

<p>When the</p>


<h3>Pigeon-Loft Floor</h3>

<p>is nailed down, set the door-jambs in place, between D J and
B H, and the window-jambs between D J and F L, as shown
by Fig. 32. Nail the jambs fast to the rest of the frame, toe-nailing
the loft door-jamb to the floor of the loft, and the
coop jamb to the ceiling of the coop, also the two horizontal
jambs of the window-frame to the two upright jambs of the
same.</p>


<h3>Shutter Frames.</h3>

<p>Over the top-piece, C D, and the bottom piece, N, nail
two boards, each about six inches wide (R and S, Fig. 32),
and upon the inside of the loft erect three boards, one at
each end and one in the middle (facing the roof of the coop),
each of the same width as the top and bottom-boards. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
is to make a framework for the shutters, with which to close
the loft in bad weather. Over the uprights just erected
nail the strips, Q, O, and P (Fig. 32). Repeat this with the
front end of the coop, E, F, K, and L, of Fig. 31, and you
will have it as represented by Fig. 32.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Framed and Roofed.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Roofing Material.</h3>

<p>There are several cheap kinds of tar and gravel-paper
sold which make neat and durable roofings, not only for
coops and sheds, but even for more ambitious structures.
In case these are not easily obtainable, roof the loft and
coop with ordinary boards, using another lot of boards to
cover the cracks between the first layer (Fig. 32).</p>

<p>It is now only necessary to nail on your sidings, and
your loft-coop is finished, all but the doors and windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Dimensions are not given for these, because it often
happens that there is some old window or hot-bed sash lying
around the place, and the jambs can be made to fit the sash.
The sash is held in place by nails, for it is not intended to
open the window, the sash only being used to let light into
the lower bantam-coop.</p>

<p>The open face of the pigeon-loft and bantam-coop are to
be covered with wire-netting, fastened securely with staple
tacks, inside the coop and loft, as shown by Fig. 33.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="600" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 33</span> and <span class="smcap">34</span>.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Doors.</h3>

<p>Fig. 34 shows how to make the doors of boards, fitted
together and secured by two cross-battens and one diagonal-batten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When the doors are hung upon their hinges the house
is finished, but not furnished. It is not necessary to have
any protection for the screen fronts during the summer,
but when winter comes four shutters, made to fit these
openings, it will be found, will keep out the storms and
protect the inmates from the cold.</p>


<h3>The Shutters</h3>

<p>may be made in the same manner as the doors, and hinged
on to the lower sill of the loft, so that when open, during
fair weather, they will rest securely upon the roof of the
coop. The coop-shutters may be hinged in the same manner
or simply fitted into place and held there by props of
some sort, which, with the shutters, may be removed in fair
weather, to admit the air and sunshine so dearly loved by
your pets.</p>


<h3>Keep Clean.</h3>

<p>I take it for granted that you know how to care for the
chickens and pigeons; that you know that no being, not
even man, can keep himself clean and healthy when confined
to a small room. The keeper must attend to all household
duties.</p>

<p>If your pets are untidy, soiled in appearance, and their
abode infested with parasites, it will be because of the cruel
thoughtlessness of their keeper. To facilitate house-cleaning,
Fig. 35 shows the internal arrangement and furniture
of the coop-loft, all of which may be removed in a few moments
and the whole place cleaned and whitewashed.</p>


<h3>The Hen’s-Nest</h3>

<p>box is made with a steep slanting roof, which will prevent
the chickens from roosting on the box. The latter has no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
bottom to it; the nests rest upon the earth, so that you
may pick up the box at any time, turn it upside down, and
turn the hose on it, or plentifully plaster it with clean,
wholesome whitewash.</p>


<h3>Pigeon-Nests.</h3>

<p>A cleat nailed to the inside wall of the loft, near the door,
serves as a rest for one end of the pigeon-nests. The other
end is supported by a piece of wood about four inches
wide which is hinged to the back wall, and its upper end
held in place by a long hook made of a piece of telegraph
wire.</p>

<p>If this hook is unfastened the wooden support falls down
and the box of nests slips off the cleat into your arms.</p>

<p>Pigeons are not good at perching upon twigs or sticks.
Their feet are adapted for walking upon flat surfaces, and
they need a broad surface for a roost. Fig. 40 shows how
to make a pigeon-roost, which may be hung up against the
wall by slipping the two holes bored in the top of the back
board over a couple of nails in the wall.</p>


<h3>For a Hen-Roost,</h3>

<p>nail a narrow strip of wood, with its flat side upon the thin
edge of another similar strip. The end will then look like
a T, Fig. 38.</p>

<p>Round off the edges of the perch with a plane or knife
until it is of the form of the right-hand diagram.</p>

<p>Fig. 37 shows a roost of this kind. Fig. 36 shows the adjustable
side-rail, with slots for the perch to fit, and Fig. 39
shows a cleat to nail against the wall for the other end of
the roost. As may be seen, the perch will fit in the slot in
the cleat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>Drinking-Troughs.</h3>

<p>Figs. 41 and 42 are drinking-troughs, arranged so that
the birds will not soil the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="600" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 35</span> to <span class="smcap">42</span>.&mdash;Interior and Furniture of Loft and Coop.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The jug-trough was made by a farm hand, friend of the
writer. He made a hole near the bottom of the jug by first
nicking off a piece of the hard glazed surface with the corner
of a hatchet, and then drilling the hole with a sharpened
nail. When the jug was filled with water, a stopper was
put in and it was set in an old dish; the water remained
above the hole in the jug, but rose no higher.</p>

<p>Fig. 42 is an</p>


<h3>Old Lard-Can,</h3>

<p>with a triangle cut in the edge. Fill the can with water and
place a dish over the top, hold the dish in place, and turn
the can upside down, and the water will fill the dish and
keep it filled to the top of the cut in the can as long as
there is water in the can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>Flying-Cage.</h3>

<p>By erecting posts at or near the lower end of the bantam-coop
and stretching wire netting from post to post, and
thence to pigeon-loft, a space can be enclosed and roofed
over with netting, which will allow your pigeons room to
exercise their wings. This arrangement does not necessarily
use up a foot more ground space.</p>

<p>There are many other simple arrangements which these
few will help to suggest to the reader, and which will add
to the comfort and happiness of his pets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO MAKE A BACK-YARD AVIARY.</span></h2>


<p>It was before the directors of the Brooklyn Institute had
met with success in their silly work of introducing the
house-sparrow (known here as the English sparrow) to this
country, and long before these foreign pests were spread
over the length and breadth of the United States, that the
court-house in Covington, Ky., was surmounted by a wooden
image of George Washington.</p>


<h3>Bird’s-Nests in Washington’s Coat.</h3>

<p>All boys know that Washington loved his country, but
few know that he was a bird-fancier. That the father of
our country loved the native birds is attested by the fact that
they built nests in the wooden wrinkles of his sleeves and in
the hollow ends of the roll of parchment which he held in his
hand. His favorite bird was the red-headed woodpecker.
He had it on the brain, and although each year a brood of
little red-headed birds were hatched in his head, the dear
old patriot never made a wry face, but with a benign smile
he gazed over the roof of the livery stable across the street.</p>


<h3>Bird’s-Nests in Speaking-Horn.</h3>

<p>Upon the same lot with the court-house stood the fire-engine-house,
with its old-fashioned lookout tower. On the
top of the tower was a weather-vane, made of a great fireman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
horn, but the only voices which ever issued from this
old speaking-trumpet were the voices of the purple martins,
singing their bubbling love songs, the twittering of their
mates, or the impatient piping of the young birds inside
their revolving home.</p>

<p>It was in the swinging, moving weather-vane of the
engine-house that these birds each year built their nests and
reared their young.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 43</span> to <span class="smcap">47</span>.&mdash;The Log may be Rounded or Square.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>A Woodpecker’s House.</h3>

<p>There is an army of interesting birds called creepers,
sapsuckers, and woodpeckers, which no one has, apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thought of providing with homes, yet it is not difficult to
suit the woodpeckers with houses.</p>

<p>A substitute for their favorite rotten tree or stump may
be made of a sound piece of timber. The log may be
squared or rounded, as in nature (Fig. 43). Saw off the
bottom so that the log may set upright, then trim off the top
end wedge-shaped, to shed the rain or to receive a roof,
which will still further protect it from the weather.</p>

<p>Next saw a deep cut as shown by the dotted line, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>.
With a large-sized auger bore a number of holes in the face
of the log; these holes must be bored deep enough to leave
a slight indentation in the main part of the log after the
piece, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, has been removed.</p>

<p>After the holes are bored begin at <b>c</b>, <b>d</b> and saw to <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>
(Fig. 43), and lift off the piece <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b> (Fig. 45).</p>

<p>With chisel and gouge cut out the nest holes. Make
them about eight inches deep, as shown in Fig. 44. Fig. 47
gives a cross-section of the hole, showing it to be of the
same form as those made by the birds themselves, in George
Washington’s head, or the old stump in the woods.</p>


<h3>The Perforated Door</h3>

<p>may now be replaced and spiked to the log, and the roof
(Fig. 46) nailed on the top, which will complete the woodpecker’s
home.</p>

<p>A better plan than spiking the door in place is to hang it
on hinges, as shown in Fig. 46.</p>


<h3>The Hinged Door</h3>

<p>should be supplied with a padlock, as a safeguard against
children and too-curious grown people. A handful of sawdust
thrown into the bottom of each nest-hole will supply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the place of the absorbent rotten wood to which these birds
are accustomed.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the English sparrow will not nest in a
swinging or moving house. If this is true we may</p>


<h3>Bring the Martins Back</h3>

<p>by supplying them with
swinging houses made of
dipper and bottle gourds,
hung to brackets or to hoops
and poles (Figs. 48 and 49).</p>

</div>


<h3>The Gourds for Bird’s Houses</h3>

<p>must be thoroughly dried,
and doorways cut in each,
near the bottom of the bowl.
Never make the entrance to
any sort of a bird-house on a
line with the bottom of the
house, for the nest will block
the doorway.</p>


<h3>Paint the Gourds</h3>

<p>bright red, green, blue, and yellow, and fasten the small
ends to the supports with copper wire, as shown in Figs. 48
and 49.</p>


<h3>The Wren-House</h3>

<p>shown in Fig. 50 is made of a grape-basket, and will not
stand rough weather, but if put in a sheltered place it will
last a long time. Wrens love to build under a roof of any
sort.</p>

<h3>Tin-Can Bird-Houses.</h3>

<p>Fig. 51 is an old fruit-can. Fig. 52 is the same nailed to
a board. These tin cans may not appear beautiful when
nailed to tree or shed, but if neatly painted and wired together
(Fig. 53) they will present a most attractive appearance.
Fig. 54 is a nest of cans, roofed. If a bunch of straw
is bound firmly together, and the opposite ends spread over
the bird-house (Fig. 55), it will make a very attractive
thatched roof.</p>


<h3>A House of Straw.</h3>

<p>A pretty and durable house may be made by binding
straw around hoops, and roofing the structure thus made
with a bunch of straw.</p>

<h3>A Barrel for a Martin-House</h3>

<p>which, when neatly made and
thatched with straw, is decidedly
ornamental, and will
be duly appreciated by your
bird friends.</p>

<p>If we can keep the English
sparrows away, the bluebirds
will nest in any sort of a sheltered
hole.</p>

<p>Earthenware flower-pots,
as shown in Fig. 59, may be
used for bird-houses if you
enlarge the holes in their
bottoms to serve as doorways,
and enclose the upper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
part between two boards (Figs. 60 and 61) which have previously
had places cut out to receive the pots. If any of
your shade or fruit-trees have</p>

<h3>Old Knot-holes</h3>

<p>in them (Fig. 62), the rotten wood can be cleaned out, a
frame nailed around the opening, and a neat little door (Fig.
63) put on the frame.</p>

<p>The door should have a hole through it, with a perch or
stick attached, and this will make an ideal bird-house.</p>


<h3>An Available Supply of Moist Clay</h3>

<p>will often induce the cliff-swallows to plant a colony in your
neighborhood, and holes made in the gable ends of your
stable will invite the social barn-swallow to build under the
protecting roof.</p>

<p>Do not fail to keep fresh water, in shallow pans or earthenware
dishes, on your lawn, for bird baths.</p>

<p>At my suggestion Samuel Jackson, my young brother-in-law,
set out baths upon the lawn last summer, and the
photograph <a href="#robinbath">on the opposite page</a> is one which he took of
a wild robin enjoying his free bath.</p>

<p>There is another</p>


<h3>Little Native American</h3>

<p>friend which the noisy sparrows are doing their best to
drive away. This is the house-wren: as interesting and busy
a little mite as ever protected a garden from noxious insects.
If you make your wren-house door the size of a silver quarter
of a dollar no robber sparrow can enter to despoil the nest.</p>

<p>Of our seven common species of swallows, four are availing
themselves of the opportunity offered by the barns for
nesting.</p>

<p>Barn-swallows build under roofs; cliff-swallows, under
eaves; the white-bellied-swallow and martin, in boxes set up
for that purpose, when these shelters are not preëmpted by
the English sparrows.</p>

<p>The native swallows destroy an amount of noxious insects
beyond calculation, and almost beyond imagination.
Without birds this world would, because of insects, be uninhabitable,
yet each year two hundred millions of them are
sacrificed <em>for women’s hats and bonnets</em>. Aside from the
inexcusable barbarity of this practice is its menace to our
trees, our crops, and our very existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A BOY’S BACK-YARD WORKSHOP.</span></h2>


<h3>How to make Buildings Plumb and Level.</h3>

<p>By a workshop is meant a place where a boy can build
a boat, sled, box-kite, man-kite,<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> mend a golf-club, a broken
bicycle, his mother’s rocking-chair, his aunt’s umbrella, or
build a paper-balloon.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is a room, house, or shed, where
a boy can do what pleases him, without being in everybody’s
way; a place where he can retire and idly whittle
a stick, or seriously work out some youthful invention; a
place where he can entertain his young friends during the
rainy or stormy days of winter, and where they can talk
over the new football team, baseball or golf club, without
being oppressed with the knowledge that their loud talk is
annoying the older folks.</p>

<p>The late war has demonstrated to the whole world the
wonderful skill and pluck of the young American, and
the world must not suppose these qualities to be suddenly
acquired, but must know them to be a matter of education&mdash;an
education acquired during boyhood, at the boy’s own
school, with boy professors.</p>


<h3>The Success of Americans</h3>

<p>is not on account of any peculiarity of the blood which
flows in their veins, but because they live under a government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which teaches independence, and the boys on the
play-ground become self-reliant, resourceful lads, developing
their skill by building kites, sleds, and boats, and developing
their pluck on the baseball and football field.</p>

<p>To such youths it is unnecessary to enumerate the advantages
of a workshop; neither is it essential to point out
to them the fact that they may commence their collection
of tools with a serviceable pocket-knife.</p>


<h3>A Good Oil-stone,</h3>

<p>to keep the knife sharp, is a prize, and for its protection
from dust or injury it should be set into a block of wood so
that about one-eighth of an inch of the stone projects above
the block. A similar block, with a space the size of the
stone and one-eighth of an inch deep cut out of its centre,
should be made for a cover.</p>


<h3>A Hatchet</h3>

<p>is not a difficult thing to procure, and a saw, a screw-driver,
a gimlet, and a three-cornered file can be added to the collection
as opportunity offers. Next a chisel or two, and
you will have a kit of tools with which, if skilfully used,
you can build anything from a three-legged stool to a flying-machine.</p>


<h3>Use the Best Tools You Can Get.</h3>

<p>With an axe or hatchet, an auger and a sheath-knife,
the whole race of pioneers, including Daniel Boone, Davy
Crockett, and the parents of Abraham Lincoln, built their
homes and made their household furniture.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that any boy, in his right mind,
will prefer an old dull auger, blunt axe, and a butcher-knife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to a chest of bright, new, modern tools, but unless a boy
belongs to the Miss Nancy, Little Lord Fauntleroy type,
he will do his best with the implements at hand, and acquire
better ones as the occasion offers. In this manner
the contents of his tool-chest will grow gradually, and keep
pace with the development of his skill as a mechanic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="300" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Such a lad, when in need of</p>


<h3>A Level,</h3>

<p>will make himself one, probably using three pieces of
board, a string, and a weight, as shown in Fig. 64. The
two side-pieces of wood being
exact duplicates in all dimensions,
the angles at the bottom
are necessarily equal,
and a line from the apex (A)
to the centre of the bottom-piece
must be a plumb line.
After sawing out his side-boards
and joining them at
their top edges, he nails a
straight piece to the bottom-ends,
using the utmost care to have the lower edge of the
bottom-board exactly the same distance from A on each
arm; that is, A B must be exactly the length of A C,
and B D must equal D C. He next cuts a small notch
at A, so that he can fit a string at the crack between the
two arms, A B and A C. A notch is also cut at D, to allow
the weight play-room. When the lower edge of the bottom-board
is placed upon a level, and the string ceases to
vibrate, it will be found that, the bullet hanging free, the
string exactly covers a line which has been previously ruled
across the bottom-board. The line was ruled by placing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
straight-edge, or rule, at A and D. The slightest incline of
the base-board will throw the string to one side or the other,
and show the base to be out of level.</p>

<p>This implement is a simple thing to construct, is as serviceable
as a spirit-level, and as reliable.</p>

<p>For buildings, a large-sized level, with side-pieces three
feet long, is useful. Smaller ones are handy in the shop.</p>


<h3>A Convenient, Home-Manufactured Plumb</h3>

<p>is made by dividing a straight piece of board with
a black line, exactly in the centre, extending from
end to end. This piece is notched at one end in
the same manner as the previous one, and a string
and weight attached, as shown by Fig. 65. By
placing the edge of this against a wall it can be
determined whether it is in or out of plumb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="150" height="382" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The boy who can manufacture these two tools
can, with the aid of other boys, build himself</p>


<h3>A Workshop;</h3>

<p>and it is possible he can do it alone, but when it comes to
lifting heavy lumber he will be glad of the assistance of
some of his friends.</p>

<p>If the reader is the happy possessor of some old locust
fence-posts, he has the best sort of material for a foundation.
Lacking locust, chestnut posts will make a good substitute.
Lacking chestnut, some carefully laid and levelled stones or
bricks will answer all purposes. I have seen many an old
house resting upon four heaps of rough stones, the latter
having faithfully supported the edifice for years, and prevented
the sills from rotting from contact with the damp
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the ground will answer for</p>


<h3>A Foundation,</h3>

<p>if the dirt is properly packed and drained. All through
certain sections of this country there are hundreds of humble
dwellings built upon “mud-sills”&mdash;in other words, with
no other foundation or floor but the bare ground.</p>

<p>I will, however, suppose that you have secured some
posts about two feet six inches long and with good flat ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="600" height="174" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The better the material you can obtain, the trimmer and
better will be the appearance of your house; but a house
which will protect you and your tools may be made of the
roughest of lumber.</p>

<p>The plans drawn here will answer for common or fine
material, but we will suppose that medium material is to
be used. It will be taken for granted that the reader is
able to procure enough two-by-four-inch timber to supply
studs, ribs, purlins, rafters, beams, and posts, for the frame
shown in Fig. 69. Two pieces of four-by-four-inch timber,
each fifteen feet long, should be procured for sills. If this
is inaccessible, two pieces of two-by-four nailed together
will make a four-by-four sill. Add to this some tongue-and-grooved
boarding for sides and roof, some enthusiasm and
good American pluck, and the shop is almost as good as built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Build the House.</h3>

<p>First lay out the foundation, eight feet by fifteen; see
that the corners are square&mdash;that is, at right angles; test
this with a tape or string, by measuring diagonally from
corner to corner both ways, and if it measures exactly the
same you are all right, and may proceed to dig your post-holes.
The outside of the posts should be flush, or even,
with the outside edges of the sills and end-beams of the
house, as shown in Fig. 66. There are to be four posts on
each of the long sides of the house, at equal distances apart&mdash;a
little less than five feet from centre to centre of each
post.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="600" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Dig the holes two feet deep, allowing six inches of the
posts to protrude above ground. If you drive two stakes a
short distance beyond the foundation, in line with your
foundation lines, and run a string from the top of one stake
to the top of the other, you can, without much trouble, get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
it upon a perfect level by testing it with your home-made
level, and adjusting the stakes until the string represents
the level for your sill. When this is done,</p>


<h3>Set Your Posts</h3>

<p>to correspond to the level of the string, then place your
sill on top of the posts, and test that with your level. If
found to be correct, fill in the dirt around the posts and
pack it firmly, then spike your sill to the posts. Go
through the same operation with the opposite
set of posts and sill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="150" height="302" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The first difficult work is now done, and,
with the exception of the roof, the rest only
needs ordinary care, and what old-fashioned
people used to term “gumption.”</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that you have already
sawed off and prepared nine two-by-four-inch
beams, each of which is exactly eight
feet long. Set these on edge from sill to
sill, equal distances apart, the edges of the
end-beams being exactly even with the ends
of the sills (Figs. 66 and 69). See that the
beams all cross the sills at right angles, and
toe-nail<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> them in place.</p>

<p>You may now neatly</p>


<h3>Floor the Foundation</h3>

<p>with one-inch boards; these boards must be laid lengthwise
with the building and crosswise with the beams.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
When this is finished, you will have a beautiful platform on
which to work, where you will be in no danger of losing
your tools, and you may use the floor as a table, on which
to measure and plan the sides and roof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a good idea to</p>


<h3>Make Your Ridge-Plank and Rafters</h3>

<p>now, while the floor is clear of rubbish.</p>

<p>Lay out and mark on the floor, with a carpenter’s soft
pencil, a straight line, four feet long (A B, Fig. 70). At right
angles to this draw another line, three feet six inches long
(A D, Fig. 70). Connect these points (B D, Fig. 70), with a
straight line, then complete the figure A B C D (Fig. 70).
Now allow two inches at the top for the ridge-plank at B,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and two by four for the end of the side plate at D. You
then have a pattern for each rafter with a “plumb-edge” at
B and a “bird’s-mouth” at D. The plumb-edge must be
parallel with B C, and the two jaws of the bird’s-mouth
(Fig. 71) parallel with D C and A D, respectively. Make six
rafters of two-by-four-inch wood, one ridge-plank of two-by-six
or seven-inch wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 70 and 71.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The “Purlins” and “Collar”</h3>

<p>can be made and fitted after the roof is raised. Set your
roof-timber carefully to one side, and clear the floor for the
studs, ribs, and plates. First prepare the end-posts, and
make them of two-by-four. Each post is of two pieces (see
Fig. 69). There will be four outside pieces which rest on
the end-beams. These will be each five feet eight inches in
length, and four inside pieces, each six feet in length; this
allows two inches at the top for the ends of the end-plates
to rest upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h3>Examine the Corner-Posts</h3>

<p>in Fig. 69, and you will see that the outside two-by-four
rests partly upon the top of the end beam, and the side-plate
rests directly upon it. You will also observe that the
inside two-by-four rests directly upon the sill, which would
make the former four inches longer than the outside piece,
if it extended to the side-plate; but you will also notice
that there is a notch in the end-plate for the outside corner-piece
to fit in, and that the end of the end-plate fits on top the
inside piece of the corner-posts, taking off two inches, which
makes the inside piece just six feet long. This is a very
simple arrangement, as may be seen by examining the diagram.
Besides the corner-posts, each of which, as we have
seen, is made of two pieces of two-by-four, there are four
studs for the front side, each six feet two inches long, and
one stud for the rear wall, six feet two inches long. The
short studs shown in the diagram (Fig. 69), on the rear side,
are unnecessary, and are only shown so that they may be
put in as convenient attachments for shelves and tool-racks.</p>


<h3>The First Stud</h3>

<p>on the front is placed two feet from the corner-post, and
the second one about six feet six inches from the first, to
allow a space for a six-foot window over the carpenter’s
bench; the next two studs form the door-jambs, and must
be far enough from the corner to allow the door to open
and swing back out of the way. If you</p>


<h3>Make Your Door</h3>

<p>two and one-half feet wide&mdash;a good size&mdash;you may set your
last stud two feet from the corner-post, and leave a space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of two feet six inches for the doorway. Now mark off on
the floor the places where the studs will come, and cut out
the flooring at these points to allow the ends of the studs to
enter and rest on the sill. Next make four ribs&mdash;one long
one to go beneath</p>


<h3>The Window,</h3>

<p>one short one to fit between the corner-post and the door-stud
(not shown in diagram), another to fit between the
door-stud and the window-stud, and another to fit between
the window-stud and the first corner-post (the nearest corner
in the diagram Fig. 69). Next make your</p>


<h3>Side-Plate</h3>

<p>exactly fifteen feet long. Fit the frame together on the
floor, and nail the pieces together, toe-nailing the ribs in
place. A lot of boys may now raise the whole side-frame,
and the ends of the studs can be slipped into their respective
slots, the end-posts made plumb, and temporarily held
in place by a board, one end of which is nailed to the top
end of the post and the other to the end-beam. Such a
diagonal board at each end will hold the side in place until
the opposite side is raised and similarly supported.</p>

<p>It is now a simple thing to slip the end-plates in place
under the side-plates, until their outside edges are even
with the outside of the corner-posts and their notched ends
under the side-plates, and resting snugly upon the tops of
the inside pieces of the corner-post. A long wire-nail
driven through the top-plates and end-plates down into the
posts at each corner will hold them securely in place. Toe-nail
a rib between the two nearest end-posts, and make two
window-studs and three ribs for the opposite end. The
framing now needs only the roof-timbers to complete</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Skeleton of Your Shop.</h3>

<p>Across, from side-plate to side-plate, lay some loose
boards, for a platform; then, standing on these boards, let
your assistant lift one end of the ridge-plank, while with
one nail to each rafter you fasten the two end-rafters on to
the ridge-plank, fit the jaws of the bird’s-mouth cuts (Fig.
71) over the ends of the side-plates, and hold them temporarily
in place with a “stay-lath”&mdash;that is, a piece of board
temporarily nailed to rafter and end-plate. The other end
of the ridge is now resting on the platform at the other end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the house, and this may be lifted up, for the single nails

<h3>The Rafters</h3>

<p>are next nailed in place, with one nail each, and a stay-lath
fastened on, to hold them in place. Now test the ends with
your plumb-level, and when they are found to be correct,
nail all the rafters securely in place; stiffen the centre pair
with a piece called a collar (see Fig. 69). Add four purlins
(Fig. 69), set at right angles to the rafters, and take off your
hats and give three cheers.</p>

<p>But do not forget to</p>


<h3>Nail a Green Bough to your Roof-tree,</h3>

<p>in accordance with the ancient and time-honored custom.
The sides of the house may be covered with the cheapest
sort of lumber, and roofed with the same material, but if
you can secure good stuff, use 13 × <span class="fnum">7</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> × <span class="nowrap">9 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span>-inch tongue
and grooved, one side planed so that it may be painted; you
can make two side-boards out of each piece six feet six
inches in length. Nail the sides on, running the boards
vertically, leaving openings for windows and doors at the
proper places.</p>

<p>If you have made a triangular edge to your ridge-stick,
as in Fig. 70, it will add to the finish, and the roof may be
neatly and tightly laid, with the upper edge of one side
protruding a couple of inches over the opposite side and thus
protecting the joint from rain. Additional security is gained
by nailing what are called picket-strips (<span class="fnum">7</span>/<span class="fden">8</span> × <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> inches)
over each place where the planks join. Lack of space forbids
me to go into many details, such as the manufacture of
the door and the arrangement of windows, but these small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
problems you can easily solve by examining doors and windows
of similar structures.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;Carpenter-Shop.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Figs. 67, 72, and 73 show the arrangement of the interior
of the shop. Near the door and against the window is a
work-bench with shelves, boxes, and tool-racks. This end
of the room is called</p>


<h3>The Machine-shop,</h3>

<p>for here are the metal working-tools, wire springs, locks,
bolts, nuts and all the odds and ends that are useful for
mending anything, from a bicycle to an umbrella. Under
the six-foot window is the carpenter’s bench for carpenter-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In Fig. 72 there is a</p>


<h3>Tool-rack</h3>

<p>across the front of the window for files, chisels, etc., but
this is only a place to thrust the tools you happen to be
using at the time. On account
of the danger of rain
from the open window, tools
should not be left in the rack
after the work is finished. In
place of drawers, wooden
boxes are made to fit loosely
into compartments prepared
for them. These boxes have
wooden handles, as shown in
the diagram, and they will
be found very convenient.
There is plenty of room
under this work-table for
more boxes when the accumulation
of materials renders
additional storing-room necessary. Sets of deep pigeon
holes are very convenient for extra bicycle spokes and similar
objects. Fig. 73 shows</p>


<h3>The Carpenter’s Bench,</h3>

<p>and a few tools stored on the wall. A board with holes bored
in it makes a good rack for hammers; saws should always
hang in an accessible place, and ordinary brass or iron hooks
may be used for this purpose.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;A Box.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>To Protect your Auger-bits</h3>

<p>from danger of rust, tack a piece of thick cloth or soft piece
of leather to the wall, using sufficient material to allow a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
flap to hang down and cover the bits. Under the flap is a
number of pockets, divided by stitching the front to the
back-piece, or by tacking the division lines to the walls.
(See the left-hand upper corner of Fig. 73.)</p>


<h3>Care of Shavings.</h3>

<p>A barrel or large box or basket should always be near
the carpenter’s bench to receive the shavings, and the stove
must be set in a box of sand or earth, to prevent any danger
of hot coals falling amid the easily ignited materials in the
carpenter-shop. (Fig. 68.) The hole in the roof, where the
stove-pipe goes through, must be protected by a sheet-iron
ring or collar.</p>


<h3>A Place for Tool-racks.</h3>

<p>The blank wall, opposite the
carpenter’s bench, may be covered
with tool-racks, shelves, and other
arrangements for the convenience
of the young workmen.</p>


<h3>To Keep Small Things.</h3>

<p>A number of old square tin
boxes, such as certain firms use for
packing cocoa, mustard, and various
other food material, may be
utilized by simply cutting off three
sides, as shown in Fig. 74, and making
a shelf with a depression for them to fit into, as shown
in the sketch.</p>

<p>This makes a most convenient nest of boxes for screws,
staples, and similar objects. Each box may be lifted out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the rack by its long back and set where it is handy, until
you are through with it; then it may be replaced in exactly
the same spot, without trouble or annoyance.</p>

</div>

<p>Figs. 75 and 75a show</p>


<h3>A Famous Old Rack,</h3>

<p>which is familiar to all who have lived in the woods. It can
be made of the branch of any shrub or tree, with the aid of
a pocket-knife, and nailed to the wall as shown in Fig. 75a.</p>

</div>

<p>Moulding, boards, and picket-strips can be stored overhead,
resting on the end-plates and the rafter-collar in the
middle of the roof.</p>

<p>This workshop has been planned so as not to crowd a
small back-yard, and if it is built of lumber which presents a
smooth outside it may be neatly painted, and will not injure
the appearance of the yard in the least. Vines may be
trained over the walls of the shop and flowers planted around
the outside, without in any manner interfering with its convenience
as a workshop, or lowering the dignity of the
young artisans who make it their head-quarters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO BUILD AN UNDERGROUND CLUB-HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p>The muffled sound of voices, interrupted by peals of
hollow laughter, issuing from the apparently solid earth, is
a sufficiently startling phenomenon of itself; but when a
group of boys and a dog suddenly emerge from the ground
it is calculated to induce the most prosaic of persons to believe
that the gnomes of fairy stories are, after all, living
realities. For the peace of mind of all who may hear the
mysterious voices and see the apparitions just described, it
may be well to state that the gnomes are human and are
members of the Bank-Swallows’ Club, and if you hear their
voices under your feet it is because you happen to be standing
on the roof of their underground club-house.</p>

<p>These</p>


<h3>American Gnomes</h3>

<p>use only such magic as their healthy brains and sturdy
arms can supply, and if they “cast a charm” upon you it
will be one of the most delightful of all spells&mdash;the charm
of boyhood!</p>

<p>The club-house may be built with</p>


<h3>A Doorway at the Top</h3>

<p>of the bank, concealed by a trap-door, or with an entrance
from the hillside, as shown in the diagrams. If the reader
chooses the first style he has simply to follow the diagrams<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
here given, and reversing the proportions of the ventilator
and entrance (Fig. 79), make an entrance of the vent and a
vent of the entrance.</p>


<h3>The Trap-Door</h3>

<p>must be placed high enough above the surface of the ground
to prevent the water from running into the house in wet
weather, and a ladder should be provided, by which the
boys may climb in and out of the house with ease.</p>


<h3>Dimensions of the House.</h3>

<p>The house should be big enough to allow room for a
table and some chairs, stools, or benches, and the roof be so
arranged that the tallest boy in the crowd may stand
erect, with no fear of bumping his head.</p>

<p>The furniture must be placed inside the frame
as soon as the floor is laid, because after the
house is finished the
entrance is too small
to admit the passage of
any object of more bulk
than a creeping
boy.</p>

<p>The hardest
work is digging
the foundation
in the hillside,
but if
six or seven
boys take a
hand at this, “for the fun of the thing,” the work is soon
done.</p>

<p>In Fig. 79 a cross-section of the earth-bank and</p>


<h3>The Boys’ Underground Club-House</h3>

<p>is given, affording an idea of the proper proportions of the
cave. When the foundation is entirely finished, collect your
building material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>If you have</p>


<h3>New Lumber,</h3>

<p>use it; if not, use old lumber, and if you are building in the
woods the house may be built of logs and roofed with poles,
covered with bark and boughs. The better the material
the stronger will be the house. Secure some good sound
planks and a supply of long strips two inches thick and four
inches wide. Use two-by-fours for the frame of the house.</p>

<p>To give a</p>


<h3>Pitch to the Roof,</h3>

<p>to allow the water which filters through the dirt above to
drain off at the eaves, make the rear posts, A, B and C, D
(Fig. 77), exactly equal in length, but considerably longer
than E, F and G, H, as in Fig. 79.</p>

<p>To add strength, erect another post midway between
A, B and C, D.</p>


<h3>Framing.</h3>

<p>Cut the sticks A, C and B, D exactly equal in length
and nail them to the uprights A, B and C, D, as in Fig. 77,
using one nail at each corner; this will adjust the frame
and make the four corners square, after which you may
secure them in position by diagonal pieces similar to those
shown on the end, A, E, B, F, Fig. 77. The corners may
then be nailed. In nailing a temporary piece it is only
necessary to drive the nails far enough to hold for the time.</p>

<p>Next make the frame E, G, H, F, and in the middle of
this frame nail on the two door-jambs I, J, and K, L. While
some of the boys hold the front and rear frames in an upright
position and the proper distance apart, others can nail
on diagonals at the two ends, and, after all is square and
plumb, the two string-pieces, A, E and C, G, may be securely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nailed in place, and the rafter M, O nailed to M, N
and O, P. This finishes the framework proper, for the
club-house.</p>


<h3>Passageway.</h3>

<p>To make the frame for the underground hall or passageway,
first nail Q, S across the door-jambs, to form the top
to the doorway, after which put in the supports Q, R and
S, T. Next build the frame U, V, X, W, and join it to Q, S
by the two pieces, Q, U and S, V, and put in the middle
frame-support marked Z, Z, Z, Z.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_119.jpg" width="600" height="311" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;The Frame.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The passageway should be about six feet long, and
the front doorway (U, V, X, W, Fig. 80) of just sufficient
size to enable you to creep through with comfort. The
bottom-piece, W, X, can be nailed to a couple of stakes
driven in the ground for that purpose. The next thing in
order is the floor, and to make this firm you must lay a
number of two-by-fours, parallel to B, D and F, H and see
that they are level. You will need a number of shorter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
pieces of the same material, to run parallel to F, H and
W, X for the hall floor, as may be seen in Fig. 79. Across
these nail your floor securely, as shown in Fig. 79.</p>


<h3>There Are No Windows</h3>

<p>to the underground house, and but two openings: one in the
roof for the ventilator, and the doorway, Q, S, L, J, Fig.
77. Since the outside of the wall of this sort of a house is
hidden by earth, it is not necessary to remove the diagonal
braces upon the ends or sides, but the inside should be
neatly finished, and the four sides must be boarded up
from the inside, after which the side-walls to the passageway
may be nailed on from the outside, the boards running
from the floor to the string-pieces, Q, U and S, V, as shown
in Fig. 79. When this is finished, roof the house, laying the
boards parallel with A, E and C, G, and allowing them to
project front and rear and overlap at the sides. Over each
crack in the roof nail another plank, as shown in Fig. 79.</p>


<h3>The Roof</h3>

<p>may be made without the overlapping boards and the cracks
covered with strips of tar-paper or old oil-cloth, or the roof
may be preserved and the cracks filled by treating the
whole to a coating of hot tar, daubed on with a brush
made from rags tied to the end of a stick. Any sort of
roof which will keep out the rain will answer the purpose.</p>


<h3>Gumption.</h3>

<p>The plans given may be, and are expected to be, altered
to suit requirements. If you use this roofing you must use
substantial supports, in the way of rafters, and put them
close together. In all cases, use your common-sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t put much earth on a frail roof; it is only necessary
to cover the boards with sufficient earth or sod to conceal
the wood.</p>

<p>Make a long box, of four boards (Fig. 82), for</p>


<h3>A Ventilator,</h3>

<p>and set this over a square hole cut in the roof for this
purpose. The ventilator should project at least one foot
and a half above ground, and the top or vent be protected
by wire-netting or cross-pieces, nailed on as shown
in Fig. 82. Now spread small brush over the boards, and
dry leaves or straw over the brush, then shovel the dirt
back in the excavation until the club-house is entirely covered;
pack the soil firmly all around the house, leaving only
the top of the ventilator and the front door uncovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 79-83.</span>&mdash;Cross-Section of House.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>When all is finished to your satisfaction, conceal the ventilator
by brush or transplanted weeds or shrubs, and scatter
grass and clover-seed over the new earth. Make a
strong door, after the plan in Fig. 81, and fasten it on the
front entrance with good hinges and a padlock, and place
some brush or growing shrubs in front of the door.</p>


<h3>After the Grass Begins to Grow</h3>

<p>there will be little to cause the passers-by to suspect that
the green bank conceals a room well supplied with chess,
checkers, boys’ books, and everything to make a boy
happy.</p>


<h3>Dangerous Caves.</h3>

<p>There is an impulse implanted in all boys, which impels
them to dig caves in every convenient bank, and these caves
are always more or less dangerous from their liability to
cave in upon the youthful miners. It not infrequently occurs
that sad accidents do happen to youngsters, who, on
account of lack of instruction, attempt to make underground
retreats in some sandy bank, by boring a hole in the
face of the hill. If, however, they make an excavation as
here directed, and illustrated by Figs. 76 and 76a, their
parents need feel no apprehension, for there is no more liability
to accident than if they were digging in the home
garden. Many of these houses have already been constructed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A BOYS’ CLUB-HOUSE ON THE WATER.</span></h2>


<p>We cannot all be Robinson Crusoes, and real desert
islands are scarce, but with a little work we can build artificial
islands, upon which Robinson Crusoe cabins of
novel designs may be erected, and by forming</p>


<h3>Crusoe-Clubs,</h3>

<p>consisting of as many members as the island homes will
accommodate, we shall have plenty of company. The
President of such a club may be called “Robinson Crusoe”;
the Secretary, “Man Friday”; the Treasurer, “The
Goat,” and the Captain, “The Parrot.” In selecting a site
for the club-house, choose a bar or shallow place in some
small lake or pond.</p>

<p>Not only is the</p>


<h3>Foundation of the Club-House Submerged,</h3>

<p>but it must be built under water, and every foot of water
adds to the difficulties. The following plans are made for
foundations to be laid in water not much over waist-deep.
For the convenience of the draughtsman, the bottom in the
diagrams is supposed to be level.</p>


<h3>The Building Material</h3>

<p>necessary is such as the lumber-pile, the farm-yard, wood-shed
or forest will supply, and the necessary tools consist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of some mauls, a saw, auger, and hatchet. Make your
own mauls, by sawing off the ends of hardwood posts and
fitting handles in holes bored
in the pieces of hardwood for
that purpose. Fig. 84 shows
a boy using a home-made
maul.</p>

</div>

<p>Should you be so fortunate
as to be able to locate
your house over</p>


<h3>A Soft Bottom,</h3>

<p>make the corner piers by
driving a number of stakes
in a circle (Fig. 84), over
which slip a barrel (Fig. 85)
which has previously had both its heads removed. If you
have no barrels a box, similarly
treated, will answer the purpose,
and in case you have no
boxes, cribs, made in the form of
boxes open at the top and bottom,
may be used. Should you
be ambitious to build in</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Placing the Barrel.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>True Robinson Crusoe Style,</h3>

<p>drive a number of long stakes
securely, in the form of a circle,
in the bottom of the pond, as
in Fig. 84, and then with grape-vines and other creepers
weave a basket (Fig. 86). “Crusoe” should know how to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
do all these things. “The Parrot” should have charge of
the transportation of material, and “The Goat” collect the
lumber, cobblestones, stakes,
and vines. All kinds of vines
and creepers are good for basket-work,
and almost any sort
of stakes will answer, but “The
Goat” must see that neither
poison-sumac nor poison-ivy is
used. Both of these plants
must be avoided in any work
of this kind, as they are extremely
dangerous to comfort,
and may cause an amount of
irritation which will confine
the victim to his bed for days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="300" height="292" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span>&mdash;The Basket.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Where vines are scarce, almost
any sort of green branches may be made to answer the
purpose, willow being especially adapted for basket-work;
but all the larger branches should be split in half to make
them pliable enough to bend without breaking. You may
now</p>


<h3>Weave a Basket</h3>

<p>by passing the vine alternately inside and outside of the
stakes in the circle (Fig. 86), and when the end of the
first piece in hand is reached you must duck your head under
water and push the vine to the bottom of the stakes.
Beginning where the last piece ended, weave a second piece
of vine and push it down to the bottom, and so on until the
top of the water is reached. It is great fun to make these
cribs, and not at all difficult work, and when they are done
and filled with cobblestones they make fine piers for a club-house
or an artificial island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>&mdash;The Foundation.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Foundation Posts</h3>

<p>of the club-house should be four or five inches in diameter
and sharpened at their lower ends, but even then you will
probably find that the united strength of several boys is
not sufficient to force them far enough into the bottom to
prevent swaying. Drive your foundation posts in the middle
of the basket-crib and then</p>


<h3>Fill the Crib with Stones.</h3>

<p>When the cribs are full, as the barrels are in Fig. 87, they
wall form durable stone piers. Four such piers will support
a house big enough for from two to four boys. In this
case the foundation posts should be long enough to form
the four corners of the house. To make the posts steady,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
nail two diagonal binders on the posts, from corner to corner,
crossing them in the centre (Fig. 87).</p>

<p>Let these diagonals be just above the water, and above
these, and out of reach of waves, nail four</p>


<h3>More Binders,</h3>

<p>in the form of a square, as A, B, C, D, in Fig. 88 are arranged.
These form the support for the floor, and four
more at the top of the corner or foundation poles will make
a support for the roof. The rest of the work is simple; it
is only necessary to lay a floor, put on a roof, and to board
up the sides to have as snug a cabin as boys need want in
summer-time. By using more piers you can make a foundation
of any size.</p>

<p>When</p>


<h3>The Bottom of the Pond</h3>

<p>is hard sand, or stones, the basket-cribs may be built on
shore in the same manner as described, but in this case it is
neither necessary nor advisable to drive the stakes far into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the earth. When finished the crib will hold together and
may be removed from the land without dislocating the
stakes, as the vines will hold them
tightly in the structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="300" height="459" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>&mdash;Barrel Cribs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>You cannot possibly force your
corner posts into the soil through
hard sand or stones, and you
must, therefore, be content to rest
their lower ends upon the bottom,
in which case make a stand for
them by spiking two short
boards, in the form of a cross,
on the lower end of the
posts, then slip your cribs
over the posts (Fig. 89).
While two boys hold the
post and crib in place the
others can fill the crib with
cobble-stones, which will
steady the post until it is
made entirely secure by diagonal
braces and the four
binders, A, B, C, D. No
matter how uneven the ends of the posts may be at first, the
top of the binders, A, B, C, D, must be exactly level.</p>

<p>The water, when calm, is</p>


<h3>Always Level,</h3>

<p>and if you measure three feet from its surface, and mark the
point on each post, you can make the binders exactly level
by nailing them with their top edge exactly even with the
three-foot mark on the corner posts. The posts may now
be sawed off even with the binders (Fig. 88) and the floor laid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>In a Large Building,</h3>

<p>four extra binders nailed to the top of the crib (E, F, G, H,
Fig. 88), will give finish to the structure, especially if they
are floored over to the edge of the top floor, thus making a
step at the surface or under the water. Stairs may be
built, as shown in Fig. 88. On hard bottoms they are anchored
at the lower end by a large stone placed upon a
board, which joins the lower ends of the side-boards; but
on soft bottoms the stairs may be first nailed to two stakes,
which are afterward driven into the mud. Fig. 90 shows
the platform finished, and skeleton house erected. To build
this house place the two
two-inch by four-inch
strips, J, N and M, Q, on
the platform at the required
distance apart,
and “toe-nail” them in
place&mdash;driving the nails
slantingly from the sides
into the floor (Fig. 92).</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 90-92</span>&mdash;Frame of House.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Temporary Diagonal Braces</h3>

<p>may be used until you
have your skeleton house
far enough advanced to
fit in some horizontal
cross-pieces between the
uprights, and to “toe-nail”
them in place. Put
in two sets of braces on
each side, one above and one below the window openings,
and in the front frame, J, K, L, M, one over the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
doorway, and two more in the rear frame, N, O,
P, Q, the latter extending from the upright, N, O, to
the upright P, Q, and parallel to N, Q, as explained by
Fig. 91. When these braces are in place your frame will
be stiff enough to nail on the sidings of slabs, boards or
poles, and after they are in position the roof may be put on
with no fear of the structure’s falling. The roof may be
made of boards, as described in the underground club-house.</p>


<h3>An Artificial Island</h3>

<p>can be made, by erecting the corner cribs and bracing them,
as described for the club-house, and then packing brush,
loaded with stones, between the boundaries of the foundation.</p>

<p>Lay the brush with the stems pointing one way and
place stones on top, one layer of weighted brush over another,
until you have reached a level two feet above the
water. Cover the top brush with hay, straw, or old leaves,
and place a layer of sods over the leaves.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation you can place as much earth as
your industry will permit, and you will have a substantial
little island, upon which grass or plants will grow, and beneath
which the little fishes can live amid the submerged
brush.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO HAVE FUN AT A PICNIC.</span></h2>


<p>If feasible take hammocks and ropes for swings along
with you and don’t forget a</p>


<h3>“Joggling-Board.”</h3>

<p>This is a very popular invention, from South Carolina,
and consists of a pine or hemlock plank, one inch thick, one
foot wide and ten feet long, which, when supported at each
end by solid supports, or ropes from the limb of a tree, forms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a seat which responds to every movement of the person
sitting in the centre, with a gentle, delightful joggle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Joggling Board.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If you use a wagon, stage, or omnibus, to reach the picnic
ground, start a game of</p>


<h3>Turnpike Loo.</h3>

<p>First divide your party into two sides, the lefts and the
rights, including the driver. Each side names and counts
all animals passed upon their respective sides&mdash;a dog, cat,
sheep, pig, cow, horse, or domestic fowl, each counts one; a
man, woman or child, five; an animal with a bell, fifteen; an
animal looking out of a barn or stable window, twenty; and
a dog, cat, or baby in a farm-house window counts fifty;
the game is two hundred.</p>


<h3>The Driver</h3>

<p>will endeavor to pass all animals upon his side; but the
leader of the left will get out at times and thwart the driver,
by chasing and coaxing the creatures to his side. The
game is exciting, producing much mirth for the picnickers
and amazement among the farmers and live-stock.</p>

<p>A great improvement upon the old-fashioned hamper of
heavy dishes is the</p>


<h3>Modern Pasteboard Box,</h3>

<p>cheap wooden pie-plates, and paper napkins. Wrap your
sandwiches in a damp linen napkin and with an outside
wrapper of confectioners’ paraffine paper and pack them,
and everything else you can, in pasteboard boxes. Salads
and similar foods may be carried in wide-mouthed glass
jars; mayonnaise dressing, sliced cucumbers and tomatoes
in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>Pack the Ground Coffee,</h3>

<p>with an egg rolled in paper, in the coffee-pot. Make the
egg into a bundle large enough to fit on top the coffee, with
no room to roll or jolt about. The butter or other grease,
left after the feast, may be melted and poured into the small
paper or wooden boxes; a wick of twisted paper or rag,
thoroughly soaked with the grease, will make a lamp.
Name the lamps, set them afloat, and the light which goes
out last is supposed to be your truest admirer.</p>


<h3>The Rhode Island Clam-Bake,</h3>

<p>the Pennsylvania Pond-Stew, the Virginia Soup, and the
Kentucky Burgoo, are about the jolliest forms of picnics
known in this country.</p>

<p>Resting in the laps of the high hills and mountains of
Pennsylvania are many small lakes. Here the picnickers
spend the forenoon capturing what edible aquatic creatures
their skill can procure, all of which are put into the stew-pan
along with vegetables, thus making a sort of fresh-water
chowder of the most appetizing nature.</p>


<h3>Burgoo.</h3>

<p>In Virginia and Kentucky it was an old-time custom for
the gentlemen to spend the forenoon hunting and fishing,
and the slaves in the afternoon cooked the game and fish in
great iron pots, hung over blazing wood fires, thus making
a most savory dish for the ladies who joined the party
toward evening. This is the origin of the Virginia Soup
and the Kentucky Burgoo.</p>

<p>The latter is the most famous, and has been enjoyed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
all great Kentuckians, from Marshall, Clay, and Lincoln, to
the present day.</p>

<p>Since the practical extermination of game, domestic fowls
are used as a substitute for wild birds. When you have a
Burgoo ask a certain number of guests to each bring a raw
dressed chicken, duck, or goose, and others to bring vegetables,
peeled and ready for the pot. The head cook, or
Burgoo-Master, brings herbs, salt, freshly ground black pepper,
salt pork, olives, and lemons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="600" height="487" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Burgoo.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a substitute for the old-fashioned, cumbersome iron
kettle, take a large, pail-shaped</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clothes-boiler,</h3>

<p>bought new for the occasion. Build your fire between two
green logs, and use the logs to support the boiler over the
flames. Half fill the boiler with water and pour in all the
vegetables and meats, and allow them to boil slowly until
the bones settle to the bottom and the other ingredients are
reduced to a pulp.</p>


<h3>It Takes Time to Properly Cook a Burgoo,</h3>

<p>and the contents of the pot must be constantly stirred, especially
when nearly cooked, in order to prevent the vegetables
and meat from burning and imparting a scorched
flavor to the soup.</p>

<p>The stirring is done with long-handled paddles, crudely
whittled by the men. The young people who take turns in
stirring, walk around the steaming caldron to the time of
vocal music, and should any maid, by accident or design,
click her paddle against one in the hands of a young man,
the young man may claim a penalty.</p>


<h3>When the Soup is Cooked</h3>

<p>it is seasoned to taste, and must be served hot. The olives
are extracted from the olive jar, and one olive placed in each
cup, with a slice of lemon. The olive liquid remaining in the
jar is poured into the hot soup and then the soup is ladled
out and poured over the lemon and olive in each cup. If
the Burgoo-Master has attended strictly to his work the
picnickers will find it one of the most delicious soups which
they have ever tasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The preparation of the Burgoo does not employ all
hands of a large party all the time, and the idle ones may
amuse themselves with</p>


<h3>A Game of Jack-Fagots.</h3>

<p>An armful of fagots is held a foot from the ground and
allowed to fall, and then the first player, with a crooked
stick, hooks out as many
fagots as possible, without
disturbing the remainder.
The slightest
movement of a fagot, not
hooked, ends the turn,
and, after counting the
score, the fagots are
bunched and allowed to
fall for the next player.
The sticks successfully
removed by each player
constitute the individual
scores.</p>

<p>In the afternoon all must join in some games&mdash;little folks,
old folks, and young folks. Choose some of the games
children play, such as</p>


<h3>Old Dan Tucker.</h3>

<p>By lot, or by old-fashioned counting out verses, let
chance decide who is to be “It,” or Tucker, and let all
the other males, big and little, select partners as they
would for a dance, and form a ring around Tucker. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a signal from “It” each player must face his partner and
sing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbasequote">“Hipperty-Hop, Hipperty-Hop!</div>
<div class="indentone">Joyfully now we sing,</div>
<div class="indentbase">As we hop to the right and hop to the left,</div>
<div class="indentone">Around Dan Tucker’s ring!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Keeping time with the music the players go, with a
hipperty-hop step, to the right of the first and to the left of
the second, weaving in and out until the partners meet;
then right-about-face and back again in the same manner
to their places. Next all join hands and</p>


<h3>Circle Around Tucker, Singing</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbasequote">“Go round and round old Tucker,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Go round and round old Tucker,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Go round and round old Tucker,</div>
<div class="indentbase">As we have gone before!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the couples are again back in their places the
song is changed, and suiting the action to</p>


<h3>The Words, They Sing</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbasequote">“I put my right hand in,</div>
<div class="indentbase">I put my left hand out,</div>
<div class="indentbase">I give my right hand a shake, shake, shake,</div>
<div class="indentbase">And turn myself about!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Using the same verse the girls now sing, “I put my
pretty face in,” etc. Then their partners sing, “I put my
‘ugly mug’ in,” etc. Then all sing “I put my right foot in,”
etc., and after the last shake of the right foot all again join
hands and advancing and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3>Crowding on Tucker</h3>

<p>from all sides, and back again to places, they sing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbasequote">“Go in and out the window,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Go in and out the window,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Go in and out the window,</div>
<div class="indentbase">As we have done before.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Changing the refrain, they next sing</p>


<h3>“Go Stand and Face Your Partner,”</h3>

<p>repeating three times, and ending with “as we have done
before.” At the last word they face their partners and give
them their right hand, their left hand to the next, and, giving
hands right and left, sing “Hipperty-Hop Hipperty-Hop,”
ending this time with</p>


<h3>“Now Let Old Tucker Join Us.”</h3>

<p>As soon as Tucker has secured the partner he wants
he shouts</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbasequote">“Get out of the way for old Dan Tucker,</div>
<div class="indentbase">You’re too late to get your supper,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the boy or man left without a partner is “It” for the
next game. The tunes for the verses can be obtained from
the children. This is all taken from children’s games.</p>


<h3>Pitch-peg-pin Pitching</h3>

<p>is a great game for hilarious fun. The pegs are sticks, two
feet long, sharpened at one end, and nine in number. Put
the pointed ends in the ground, forming a diamond, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
each peg two feet from its nearest neighbor, and the one
at one apex about twenty feet from a taw-line.</p>


<h3>Let All the Girls,</h3>

<p>big, little, married, and unmarried, form one side, and an
equal number of boys, old and young, form the other side.
The boys then choose a First Lady, who is to lead their
opponents, and the girls choose a First Gentleman, who is
to command the men. With three short clubs in her hands
the First Lady toes the taw-line and endeavors to knock
all the pegs down, in three consecutive throws with the
clubs.</p>

<p>The pegs are then reset, the score recorded, and</p>


<h3>The First Gentleman Takes</h3>

<p>the clubs and his turn. When all have had a turn the individual
scores are compared, and the right arm of each man
or boy is bound with a pocket-handkerchief to the left arm
of the girl, woman or matron whose score most nearly approaches
his own, and the First Lady and First Gentleman
choose up for sides, taking a couple at each choice. In the
order of their score number, the couples now take their turn
pitching clubs at the pins, the man, of necessity, using his
left hand and the woman her right to throw the clubs,
which they do simultaneously.</p>


<h3>The Scores</h3>

<p>are again compared and the couples bound into fours, and
the fours into sixes, until each side is bound into a continuous
line, with only the left hand of the end man and the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hand of the end woman to pitch-peg-pin with, and make the
final score of the game.</p>


<h3>Lawn Hab-enihan.</h3>

<p>Mark with a whitewash brush upon the grass, scratch
with a stick upon the bare ground or hard sand of a shore,
twelve concentric circles. Number the rings from the outside
to the centre.</p>

<p>Supply each player with a dozen smooth stones, about
the size of the palm of one’s hand. If you can get flat, water-washed
stones, with rounded edges, they make the best
“Habs.” Standing upon the taw-line at the distance from
the target agreed upon, each player in turn pitches a hab at
the target, or “Enihan,” leaving a stone inside the circle
struck. But if his hab rests upon a line which bounds the
rings he loses his turn after the first shot. The player may
remove a hab from the circle last struck, or set another hab
in it, or, counting from where any one of his habs rests, can
move that hab as many circles toward the centre as corresponds
with the number of the circle last struck.</p>

<p>If this moves the hab to the centre and leaves some
figures over he can place a new hab forward as many rings
as correspond with the numbers left over. If any player
can cast two habs into a circle occupied by some other
player’s hab, the successful player captures the other hab
and removes it. The game consists of any specified number
of points, and when any one of the players has no habs on
the enihan the game is ended. Then each player counts the
number of his habs in the centre and the number of captured
habs, and whoever has the most adds to his or her individual
score the number of habs left on the enihan. The players
have three objects constantly in view: to protect his or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
her habs from capture by getting more than one in the same
circle, to work to the centre, and to capture the opponent’s
habs. This is an exciting outdoor game, which may be
played with the material at hand, and when two players
have each a hab in the same circle, and each hab is moving
nearer and nearer the centre, the danger of a lucky shot and
capture keeps them “guessing.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO BUILD AND HOW TO FURNISH A
DANIEL BOONE CABIN.</span></h2>


<p>Imagination is a great thing and can do wonders; it
can surround the most commonplace objects with an atmosphere
of romance, in which nothing is impossible or improbable.
A whiff of smoke from the fireplace where wood
is burning, means nothing but a faulty chimney; yet, as the
smell of burning wood reaches the nostrils, Association
sets the wheels of</p>


<h3>Imagination’s Mill</h3>

<p>whirring, and all unbidden come visions floating through
our minds of camps, camp-fires, fish&mdash;pickerel, bass, and
trout; quail, rabbits, and venison-steaks, broiling over the
hot coals. My, it makes a fellow hungry to think of such
good things! Roasted ears of sweet-corn, flapjacks, and
corn-dodgers, “piping hot,” pass in a procession before us,
and, as the sparks fly up the chimney,</p>


<h3>The Ghosts of the Fireplace</h3>

<p>troop in: and a hale and husky lot of ghosts they are, with
their coon-skin caps, buckskin clothes, and beaded moccasins.
Each ghost wears a strap slung over his shoulder,
from which hang a bullet-pouch and a curiously engraved
cow-horn powder-flask; as they file by, with their long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
single-barrelled flint-lock rifles, we are not surprised to see
among them the great Daniel Boone, his friend Simon Kenton,
and the unique, dashing, Davy Crockett.</p>

<p>All in vain do the trucks thunder by our windows, and
futile are the efforts of the clanging cable-car bells and the
roar of the great city to recall us to the present humdrum
times. We are under the spell of the king of magicians,
and our minds are wandering free in the wild woods; we
can even hear the distant wolves howl, and the blood curdling
yell of the painted savage. Is it a wonder that we
love the generous old-fashioned fireplace? Is it strange
that the log-cabin is dear to the hearts of American boys?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Log-House</h3>

<p>saw the birth of our nation; its rude interior sheltered our
great men, and beneath its slabbed roof heroes were born.
To-day it is still the most practicable, durable, and simply
constructed house invented for a forest home, and any boy
can build a log-house large enough to form a comfortable
camp for vacation days. For muscles unaccustomed to such
exercise it is hard work to cut down large trees, and, unless
the young woodsman has served an apprenticeship on
a farm or in a lumber-camp, it is dangerous work to fell big
timber; but any lad may cut down</p>


<h3>Trees of a Smaller Growth,</h3>

<p>without danger to life or limb. Small-sized logs save much
labor in chopping, sawing, rolling, and “snaking” to camp;
besides all this, logs of small diameter look best for a house
of small dimensions.</p>

<p>Therefore, in selecting the material for your proposed
house, choose only such trees as are best suited to the
strength of the builders. There is no rule which fixes the
diameter of a log or pole, so a log-house is a log-house, no
matter whether the diameter of the log from which it is built
be four inches or four feet. When a log is hauled by men,
horses, or oxen, through the woods, it is called “snaking.”</p>


<h3>The “Skid”</h3>

<p>is two or more logs laid on the ground, upon and across
which the other logs are piled up for use. Common-sense
will direct you to select only the timber which comes nearest
being straight, and also to cut the logs considerably
longer than the length marked on the plan.</p>

10 feet long, inside measurement.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 95 is a rough sketch and plan of two such cabins
under one roof, with a hallway, or “gallery,” as they call it
in the South, between them. Fig. 96 is a plan of the saddle-bag.
In this sketch you will see how your house may be
enlarged, at any time, by the addition of a duplicate house,
with a roofed space between the two.</p>

<p>First decide upon the exact spot where you intend to</p>


<h3>Locate Your Cabin,</h3>

<p>then stake out the cabin according to your plans, and clear
the ground for the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>To facilitate rolling the logs as you need them, arrange
some skids close by the site of the house, and allow them to
slant toward the proposed cabin.</p>

<p>If there are any stones handy,</p>


<h3>Build a Foundation</h3>

<p>by making a pile of stones a foot or two high, at each of the
four corners, in such a manner that the logs resting on these
supports will be at the same level at each end, level with
each other, and exactly six feet apart.</p>


<h3>For Floor-Joists</h3>

<p>take a number of strong poles, and, with a sharp hatchet,
give them a flat side for the floor-boards to rest upon, and
trim off each end, wedge-shaped, as shown by Fig. 94, the
rough sketch at the bottom right-hand corner of Fig. 93.</p>

<p>You understand, of course, that</p>


<h3>The Floor-Supports</h3>

<p>must be of sufficient length to reach from the front sill-log
to the back sill-log. Nail each joist at each end to the sill-logs,
and place them
about two feet apart.
If it is thought that
the flooring of the
cabin makes too
much work, you may
build one with a
“mud-sill,” by using
the hard earth for
floor and foundation.
Abraham Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
lived in a “mud-sill” house, and there are hundreds of such
houses in the Southern States.</p>

<p>With the exception of the sill-logs, all the logs are
notched at both ends and on both sides (Figs. 97 and 98);
the sill-logs are notched at both ends, but only on one side,
as shown by Fig. 98. Logs of the same diameter as the sill-logs
can be laid between them on the bare ground and used
for joists, but the best plan is a stone foundation, and a plank
floor at least a foot or two above the earth.</p>


<h3>Log-Rolling.</h3>

<p>Now is the time to invite all your friends to a grand old-time
log-rolling; ask the girls to come and cook the coffee
and make the sandwiches.</p>

<p>The two end-logs may first be rolled down from the skids,
notched and fitted in place across the ends of sill-logs (Fig.
93), and then the next two side-logs, and so on, alternating
until the walls are built; but you must remember to allow
for the doors, windows, and fireplace openings. When the
walls are so high that it is a difficult task to lift the logs in
position, put up a couple of skids and roll the logs up the
incline, which is better than wasting your strength in trying
to lift such burdens. When the walls have reached the
height of the top of the lowest opening, nail some</p>


<h3>Door and Window Opening</h3>

<p>planks, temporarily, close to the proposed opening on both
sides of it, and on the inside and outside of the house; this
is to hold the logs in position while the opening is being
cut. A, in Fig. 99, shows a binder. After the binders are
in place, saw the top log through at the proposed opening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to allow room for the saw, and then proceed to build as
before. See Fig. 98, showing opening over door and window;
the binders are not shown in this diagram.</p>

<h3>A Fireplace</h3>

<p>is by no means an absolute necessity for a summer cabin,
but an open fire is a great addition to a house, and upon
cool evenings, even in the summer-time, its genial warmth
is not to be despised. The protruding ends of the logs, at
the four corners of the cabin, may be left as they happen to
be until the house is finished, no matter how irregular their
appearance. With a two-handled saw, and a boy at each
end, the ends may be cut off evenly; this will give a finished
appearance to the cabin. You can have</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>Any Sort of a Roof</h3>

<p>which suits your fancy; it may be framed, as described in
Chapter VII., or, by using round poles, it may be framed
as shown by Fig. 98 and roofed with slabs or planks, as
shown by Fig. 100, or the roof may be shingled with “clapboards,”
a name used for shingles or boards, about three
feet long, and laid on as ordinary shingles are&mdash;first course
at the eaves, second course breaking joints and overlapping
the first, and so on, until the roof-tree is reached.</p>

<p>If shingles, clapboards, and planks are out of reach, the
roof may be shingled with bark; if birch bark is used, it
can be held in place by poles laid upon the outside of the
roof, as I have often seen the hand-rived clapboards held in
place where they use no nails in the construction of their
homes.</p>


<h3>The Most Essential Piece of Furniture</h3>

<p>for the house, if you are to live in it, is the bed or bunk.
This can be made in various simple and effective patterns.
At the Sportsmen’s Show in New York there was
an elaborately constructed bedstead, made of the rough
branches of trees, but however ornamental this style of
couch may be, it is not essential to comfort, and requires
time and skill to manufacture, neither of which the average
boy is willing to lavish on camp furniture.</p>


<h3>The Bunks</h3>

<p>shown in the plan (Fig. 93), are made with two horizontal
poles, flattened at the ends and upon one side, after the
manner of the rough sketch at the Fig. 94. These poles
extend from side to side of the cabin, and rest upon the logs
of the wall, to which they are securely nailed. The ends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
are further supported by a cross-plank, or pole, fastened
to the walls, as a support for the side-rods of the bunk.
Slats are made of sticks split
in half and nailed to the side-bars,
as shown in the plan.
One bunk is placed over another,
until there is no room
for more, and then the three
or more bunks are filled with
straw, hay, or spruce boughs,
over which the blankets are
spread, and the bed is made.</p>

<p>With a mud-sill house you
can</p>


<h3>Make a Lincoln Bed.</h3>

<p>Abraham Lincoln’s father
had no bedstead, and no means
of getting one but to make
it, and no tools but an auger
and axe to make it with. A
stake was driven in the ground, near the corner of the cabin,
about four feet from one of the walls, and six feet from the
other. Auger-holes were then bored in the wall opposite,
and poles driven into them, the other ends meeting on the
stake; across these were laid laths rived from an oak, and
upon them rested the straw-bed of our great President.</p>

</div>


<h3>When Your House is Crowded,</h3>

<p>the floor offers space for sleepers, and you may “choose
up,” for first choice. As a rule the top berth is first choice,
as in it you feel less cramped for breathing-space, for there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is nothing but the roof above you. Unless the boys are
more than usually expert builders, there will be no lack of
fresh air, even when your house is crowded. To prevent
too much wind entering, it is well to</p>


<h3>Stuff all the Spaces Between the Logs</h3>

<p>with mud or clay, mixed with moss, and while some of the
boys are in the woods gathering the moss, and others mixing
and dampening the clay, the more skilled mechanics can</p>


<h3>Make the Door</h3>

<p>and hang it in the doorway, which, with the other proposed
openings, may be now sawed out and heavy jambs nailed
on, before the binders are removed. The wooden hinge of
the door can be made of ash, hickory, or oak, and may be
simply a straight stick or rod about six and a half feet
long and two inches in diameter (Fig. 105). Bore a hole
in the upper log over the doorway, about six inches deep;
if the log is of less diameter than this, bore the hole through
the log. Bore a hole in the lower, or sill-log, but make it
only deep enough to securely hold one end of your hinge-rod,
and then trim the rod to fit in this hole, making it a
trifle shorter than the distance between the end of the top
hole and the end of the sill hole. Flatten one side of the
hinge-rod, so that it may fit neatly along the edge of the
door, but do not fasten it on the door until after the rod is
in place. Spring the rod in place by slipping the top end
into the top hole as far as it will go, and then pushing the
bottom end over the sill hole. When it slips in place set
the door up, in the position it would be when wide open,
and fasten it to the flattened edge of the hinge-rod, with
good strong screws. Close the door and mark the edge on
the jamb, then nail a narrow strip of wood along the line, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
prevent the door swinging any farther than it is necessary
for it to swing when closed; or make it as shown by Fig. 105,
and hang it with iron hinges, as doors at home are hung.</p>

<h3>If You Have Money to Spend,</h3>

<p>and men to work under your directions, you can have the
regulation door, floor, and roof; the cracks in the wall
calked with mortar, and a stone or brick chimney and fireplace
built. In fact, you can make a palace of logs, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
plate-glass windows, but <em>you will not have a log-cabin, and you
will miss all the fun to be derived from creating something by
your own labor</em>, which is the highest sort of joy&mdash;the joy of
the artist! Any “chump,” with money, can hire men to
build houses which would be impossible for his stupid brain
and clumsy hands to accomplish. Besides which, the men
he hired to do the work would be the only ones who derived
any real pleasure from the construction of the houses.</p>

<p>You must not understand from this that you are to use</p>


<h3>Oiled Paper for Glass, in Your Windows,</h3>

<p>if you can obtain real glass, but that in case you cannot, the
paper makes a good substitute, and one which was used in
many a pioneer’s cabin. In Virginia there are log-houses,
still occupied, which have not even a paper window&mdash;a hole,
closed in bad weather by a wooden shutter, being the only
opening besides the doors, and the moonshiners of the mountain
districts seldom have windows at all, but depend upon
a front and rear door to supply light for the house, and when
these doors are closed the fire supplies the illumination.</p>


<h3>The Lamps</h3>

<p>they use, when they have any, are small pans or saucers
filled with melted fat, in which a piece of rag is placed, and
furnishes a wick for this primitive light. In 1897 I was
given one of these “Betty lights” by a mountain host, to
light me to bed.</p>

<p>Every boy’s log-house should be supplied with lanterns
and candles, but the candles must be stored in tin boxes,
otherwise</p>


<h3>The Brownies Will Eat Them.</h3>

<p>Brownies are the wild wood-mice and flying-squirrels
which will use your house during your absence, and not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
eat the candles, but anything else you may leave unprotected.
They ate up my soap, and then, for dessert, went
to the kitchen and ate up the stove-polish. In small houses
you will probably not have stove-polish, or stoves.</p>

<p>After the opening in the wall of the cabin for the fireplace
is sawed out, you may build up a good, strong wall, on
the three outer sides of</p>


<h3>The Fireplace</h3>

<p>(Figs. 106 and 107). Build these walls as you did the cabin
walls, and fit the ends of the logs neatly against the cabin
logs, and put “chunks” in between the logs at the cabin end,
to level them. When the walls are as high as the opening
in the cabin, you are ready to begin the work of building
the inside clay-lining.</p>

<p>It will take a considerable quantity of clay to finish your
fireplace and chimney, and a rough box, like the mortar-box
used by builders, will be found most convenient for mixing
the clay.</p>

<p>Saw off the ends of some sticks of wood and make some</p>


<h3>Wooden Hammers, or Mauls,</h3>

<p>of them, by boring holes through the pieces you have sawed
off and putting handles in the holes. These mauls may vary
from three to five inches in diameter, and will be found to
be the most convenient sort of tool for breaking the dry
clay before it is dampened, and they will also be of great
service in beating the clay down, for the fireplace and hearth.
Make the floor to the fireplace and the hearth by spreading
the damp clay over the space and hammering it down until
it is hard; add more clay, and beat it until the hearth and
fire-floor (Figs. 107 and 108) are level and firm. You may
then put on enough water to make the surface slippery, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
smooth it off with a trowel made of a shingle and a branch,
after the manner of the one shown in the foreground of
Fig. 98.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 101-105.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Next Build Your Clay Walls</h3>

<p>on the inside, against the log outside walls, and extending to
the inside of the cabin wall. Make the clay into the form of
bricks and build up the jambs and lining, about one foot
thick, to the top of the fireplace, using wet clay for mortar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="600" height="446" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 106 and 107.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>For the Chimney</h3>

<p>split some sticks and make them about one inch wide by one
and one-half inch thick, and with clay for mortar build the
chimney, log-cabin style (Fig. 106), to the required height,
leaving a space between the chimney and outside wall of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
house. Plaster it well with clay, especially upon the inside,
and be careful to keep it plumb.</p>

<p>A short time ago, while on a sketching trip through the
mountains of East Tennessee and Kentucky, I saw hundreds
of these</p>


<h3>Stick Chimneys</h3>

<p>which have done service for years. Some of them were
beautiful specimens of skill, while others had a decided list
to port or starboard, as a sailor would say, and were apparently
carelessly made.</p>

<p>In the mountains the fireplaces are lined with stones, in
place of clay, but in Illinois, where stones are scarce and
mud plenty, the old-time log-cabin hearth and fireplace
were always made of clay.</p>

<p>Besides the berths or bunks already described, a table
and some benches, or three-legged stools, will be found
very useful articles of furniture. In a small house a</p>


<h3>Table Takes Up Needed Room,</h3>

<p>and as it is principally used at meal-time, a contrivance that
may be put away when not in use is most desirable; such a
table can be made of two wooden horses, with boards laid
across them. When the weather is fair the table may be
set out-doors, and when the weather is foul it can be placed
in-doors. The horses and boards may be kept on the porch,
if you have one, or in a shed or on the rafters overhead.</p>


<h3>Three-Legged Stools.</h3>

<p>A piece of two-inch plank, with three oak, ash, or hickory
sticks driven into three holes bored for the purpose,
makes a stool which will last a lifetime. Two such stools<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
have been in use for twelve or thirteen years in my Pike
County (Pa.) cabin, and are just as good as new to-day.</p>

<p>Now, when your work is done and you balance yourself
on a three-legged stool, and rest from your labors, remember
you are sitting on what has before now proved to be the
incipient Presidential chair.</p>


<h3>General Camp Notes for Old Boys.</h3>

<p>If the boys suppose that their parents are not interested
in out-door life, they are mistaken, for the author
never fails to receive a batch of letters from grown-up people,
whenever he publishes an out-door article for the boys.
That the boys may answer the questions put to the author
by the parents, and incidentally profit themselves by the information,
the following suggestions to campers are given.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, when talking to the old people,
the question of having sufficient funds is not taken as strictly
into account as it is in all the plans for the boys themselves.</p>


<h3>When You Start for Camp</h3>

<p>leave artificialities and fripperies behind, packed up in camphor,
and bring only your free, untrammelled self with you,
and ho! for a frolic, for flapjacks and coffee, sweet-scented
spruce boughs, camp-fires, and the fireside song, and the
music of the banjo. Let your first care be to secure cheerful,
happy companions, as the most important articles for
your camping outfit.</p>

<p>White flannel trousers and blazers are for the seaside
and summer resorts, not for camp. You go to camp for
health and fun, not for display; therefore leave your good
clothes in your trunk at the last railroad station, to be
called for when you quit the woods and once more enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the land of creased trousers and starched shirts, of stocks,
long skirts, and ties.</p>


<h3>How the Women Should Dress.</h3>

<p>A woman’s camp-dress should consist of a scant, short
skirt, bloomers, leggings, and stout, broad-soled shoes, loose
shirt-waist, and Norfolk jacket, the latter plentifully supplied
with pockets. Whatever prejudice a woman may have
against short skirts and bloomers is soon overcome after
she has tried to climb fallen trees and rocks, or made her
way through thick underbrush, encumbered with the absurd
long skirts of the house or street, or after she has
tramped to camp with a wet and bedrabbled skirt flapping
around her ankles, caused by a walk in the dewy morning,
or a paddle in a leaky boat. Women should have their
dresses made of strong material, with “lots of pockets,”
like a man’s hunting-clothes. They will find their capabilities
for enjoyment greatly enhanced by this, and the men,
at least, will think them just as bewitching and far better
companions than they would be if they were dressed in
city gowns, hats and feathers, and low shoes.</p>


<h3>The Requirements for a Camp.</h3>

<p>Each person in camp should be supplied with a good,
big-bladed jack-knife; a woodsman, or, what is about the
same thing, a person with good common-sense, can supply
himself with food and shelter, with no other ready-made
tool than a good strong knife.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper, and sugar, must be put on the list; then
flour in sack, oatmeal, cornmeal, rice, and lard; crackers,
beans, coffee in tin, tea in bag, cocoa, condensed milk in cans,
evaporated cream in cans, butter in pail, pickles, dried fruit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in bags, a bag of potatoes, molasses, pork, boneless bacon,
and, if you are fond of it, a few jars of orange marmalade;
sal-soda for sweetening “dubs,” and ginger for medicinal
purposes; several cakes of common soap for dish-washing,
some dish-towels, and some soap for toilet purposes; also
a tin coffee-pot, a long-handled frying-pan, a small griddle,
a nest of tin pails, the smallest capable of holding a quart
or less, and the largest a gallon or more; two or three
paper pails or water-buckets, two or three iron kitchen
spoons and forks, and a camp boiler, a firkin and a wooden
spoon, also a strong axe and a hatchet.</p>


<h3>From the Stand-point of Health.</h3>

<p>It is presupposed that people who intend to spend their
vacation in camp are lovers of the beautiful; consequently,
in selecting a camping-place, a spot should be chosen which
gives the finest possible view of mountains, lakes, or rivers,
even if some inconvenience must be suffered in the selection.
The camp must be dry and well-drained, so that in
case of sudden storms there will be no danger of the water
flooding the tents, wetting the bedding or spoiling the
food. A gentle sloping ground is best. Avoid locating in
the track or below the mouths of innocent-looking gullies
or ravines, that may, in case of rain, be developed into
torrents of muddy water, and sweep the camp like a cloudburst.</p>

<p>A supply of pure water contributes as much to the enjoyment
of the campers as to the preservation of health.
Common-sense will direct that the camp be selected within
easy reach of some bubbling spring or fresh, uncontaminated
brook of running water, but there is another thing
of paramount importance, and that is a handy supply of
fuel. The latter is of even more importance than that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
water. With a wooden man-yoke, water is easily transported
for quite a distance, but no one who has not tried
it can realize the difficulty of carrying fuel even a short
distance.</p>


<h3>Making the Shack or Shelter.</h3>

<p>The Adirondack camp is made from the materials furnished
by the forest, and it is put together in the form of a
shack or shelter, by the woodsmen or guides. Spruce-trees,
eight or nine inches in diameter, are cut down, quickly
stripped of their bark, and one of them suspended between
two trees eight or ten feet from the ground, or is supported
by forked sticks. Others are then laid standing up to
it, and the incline is shingled with the bark, to keep out the
rain. Your bed is on the ground beneath the bark roof.
Put a log at the head, and a smaller one at the foot, and
cover the intervening space with a thick layer of flat spruce
boughs, neatly laid, with all the unnecessary sticks thrown
out; chop down some young balsams and strip them of all
their twigs; selecting all those of about twelve inches in
length, begin at the foot of the bed and work up, sticking
the butt-ends of the balsam twigs into the spruce boughs.
Place them as close together as possible, with their tops
slightly inclining to the foot of the couch. After all the
balsam is planted scatter the fine tips of some hemlock
boughs over the balsam, and spread your blanket over all.
Any bag or pillow-case, filled with hemlock and balsam tips,
makes a good, sweet-scented pillow. All that then remains
to be done is to fill up the ends of the shack with brush,
roll a back-log in front of your camp, and start the fire.
At night spread your blankets on the spruce twigs, stretch
yourself out and watch the dying embers of the fire until
you gradually drift into the sweet slumber of the camper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Brush-Covered Lean-to</h3>

<p>is a triangular tent, open in front, made of one piece of
canvas fastened to a horizontal pole in front, to the ground
in the rear, and hanging down at the sides. Over this a
rude, shack-like Adirondack camp is built, not to keep out
rain but to protect the canvas, with the green brush, from
sparks from the camp-fire. In no case must the brush touch
the cloth, for during a rain the canvas will leak wherever
any object is resting against it, either from the inside or
outside.</p>

<p>A tent is the favorite abode of all campers. They are
transported with much greater ease than the most simply-constructed
portable house. A tent may be erected with
the expenditure of less labor than any of the preceding
camps, and furnishes a comfortable shelter all the year
round. Even in the bleak mountains of Alaska tents are
often used by miners, wintering near their mines. A good
wall-tent, with a fly and a wooden floor, is protection enough
for the most delicate of persons.</p>

<p>Standard drills and yacht twills are better adapted to the
camper’s purposes than heavier materials, and besides are
less expensive. The list prices of wall-tents, from nine by
nine feet to sixteen and a half by fourteen feet, are from $14
to $26. The flies are listed at from $4.50 to $9.70.</p>


<h3>In Tents with Roofed Verandas.</h3>

<p>The Amazon tents are in the form of a lean-to, with a
roofed veranda, so to speak, in front.</p>

<p>Shanties are small houses of plank, roofed with plank, and
are built by the natives, at costs varying with the price and
accessibility of the lumber. A good, water-tight shanty
ought to be erected in most sections for about $25. Bunks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of planks are built in the shanties, one above the other, and,
when filled with straw and covered with a blanket, make
comfortable sleeping-quarters.</p>

<p>Portable houses are now manufactured of all forms and
sizes, from a child’s small playhouse to a two-story frame
store. These buildings are made in sections; all parts are
numbered and labelled, and may be put together and taken
apart at will. Many of these houses are designed especially
for camps, and may be shipped to the camping-ground with
little trouble and erected with little loss of time. At the
same factory may be purchased terra-cotta chimneys, in
sections, ready to be stacked up for use. Some people prefer
to build a chimney of stone or brick and leave it standing
when the house is moved, others making stovepipe serve
for a chimney.</p>


<h3>What is Needed for Table and Larder.</h3>

<p>For table furniture select white blue-rimmed cups and
saucers, and plates of granite-ware. The gray enamelled
ware is not as good, for many
reasons. These enamelled or
granite-ware dishes are as easily
cleaned as china, but, unlike
china, they will not break. Nickel-plated
teaspoons are in every
way as good as silver for camp
purposes, and should not cost
more than three cents apiece.
Knives and forks to match can
easily be found. Be sure they
are modern ones with three tines.</p>

</div>

<p>Lay in a supply of candles, and two or three common
stable lanterns. You may add to these items as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
luxuries as your baggage will supply room for, or your purse
or taste dictate. Fruit syrups, such as are used at reputable
soda-water fountains, make very pleasant and healthful
drinks when combined with good, cold spring-water.
Lemons will keep in a cool, dry place for two weeks, and as
a garnish for fish or soup not only give an appetizing look,
which, as a rule, is unnecessary in camp food, but they add
to the taste and relish, which is a property that persons
blessed with good appetites appreciate, even when on a
camping expedition.</p>

<span class="titlefont">A FLAT-BOATMAN’S HORN.</span></h2>


<p>It was in the golden age of
whittling that wooden bugles
and the Wabash horns were in
their prime.</p>

<p>It is hardly an exaggerated figure of speech to say that
the United States, with all its power and wealth, has been
whittled out of the raw material by our ancestors, with their
Barlow knives.</p>

<p>I think I have already told the readers, in one of my
other books, that the practice of</p>


<h3>Whittling</h3>

<p>was not formerly confined to the youth of the country;
lawyers, merchants, and statesmen, were adepts in the art,
and on the counter of every well-regulated tavern was always
to be found a heap of sweet-smelling cedar sticks for
the guests to whittle, after meals.</p>

<p>Even as early as Puritan times the jack-knives were
busy, and the little conscience-stricken Nathaniel Mathers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
confesses that “of the manifold sins which then I was guilty
of none so sticks upon me as that, being very young, I
was <em>whittling on the Sabbath day</em>, and for fear of being seen
I did it behind the door.”</p>

<p>Times have changed since this poor little chap hid behind
the door to whittle a stick, and some of the less conscientious
descendants of the Puritans would not dare now
to whittle on Sunday, or any other day, for fear of cutting
their clumsy, untrained fingers. But the fingers of the
readers of this book, I trust, are skilful in the use of a
pocket-knife, and for them it will not be a difficult task to
make a Wabash, or Flat-boatman’s, wooden horn.</p>

<p>The wooden horn was the particular favorite of the jolly,
reckless flat-boatmen. Its soft musical notes sounded
especially sweet and mellow in the early morning, when the
boatmen were casting loose their cables from their moorings.
From Pittsburg to New Orleans the reveille of the
boatmen’s horns announced the dawn of another day.</p>

<p>Descriptions of these horns have come to us from our
pioneer grandparents, and printed accounts can only be
found by rummaging among old Western papers. The
Frankfort (Kentucky) <cite>Commonwealth</cite>, in 1836, published
some verses extolling the boatman’s music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentbase">Oh, boatman, wind that horn again!</div>
<div class="indentone">For never did the joyous air</div>
<div class="indentone">Upon its lambent bosom bear</div>
<div class="indentbase">So wild, so soft, so sweet a strain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this horn was made of the same material as the boat.
They performed upon a wooden bugle of long conical shape,
constructed of small wooden staves, which, according to all
accounts, produced sounds of a wonderfully sweet tone.
On a beautiful, clear and still morning the echoes of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
boatmen’s trumpets, prolonged at a great distance through
the neighboring woods and hills which bordered the river,
are said to have possessed a charm and enchantment which
none can realize but those who have heard them.</p>

<p>The Western boatmen were not the only ones who used</p>


<h3>Wooden Bugles,</h3>

<p>for there is an instrument of this kind still preserved in
Kentucky, and is now, or was a few years ago, in the possession
of Mrs. Annie Mayhall, a granddaughter of Captain
Robert Collins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="600" height="342" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 109 and 110.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Colonel Richard Johnson made a famous charge in the
war of 1812, and Captain Bob Collins sounded the charge
on his home-made cedar horn.</p>

<p>If there are any illustrations of this charge, the bugler
will no doubt be represented as blowing on the regulation
brass instrument; but you must remember, boys, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
artists were not in that fight. Artists have a way of doing
things up fine, as may be seen by the pictures of our</p>


<h3>Revolutionary Soldiers,</h3>

<p>all in regulation uniforms, when
the truth is that there was scarcely
a uniformed regiment in the army.
The grand old fellows fought in
their hunting garb, or the dress
they wore on the farm, in the
store, the church, or the tavern;
and while they may not have used
wooden horns, it is very probable
that many a Continental bugler
carried an old cow’s-horn, with
which to sound the reveille.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" width="250" height="269" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 111.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the bugle which sounded the death-knell of the
great Indian chief Tecumseh was</p>


<h3>The Old Wooden Horn of Captain Bob Collins.</h3>

<p>It was made of two cedar slabs, three-sixteenths of an
inch in thickness, and these were trimmed and bent so that
when their edges were joined they formed a funnel-shaped
instrument which was about four inches in diameter at the
bell or larger end, and tapered down to a convenient size at
the small end, or mouth-piece. The two cedar slabs were
held in place by hoops made of cow’s-horn.</p>

<p>Whether it was a habit acquired in the army, or whether
Captain Bob was once a flat-boatman, is not recorded, but
certain it is that the doughty Captain always sounded the
reveille at sunrise, and it was not until 1864, when death
called the old man home, that the neighbors, for miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
around, saw the sun rise unheralded by the notes of the
quaint instrument.</p>

<p>To make a horn like Captain Bob’s requires nice work
in steaming, bending, and joining the cedar slabs, but Captain
Bob belonged to the Barlow-knife age, and undoubtedly
knew how to use one.</p>

<p>Fortunately for boys less skilful than this old pioneer, our
ancestors have furnished us another kind of horn, which
any boy can make. The original sketches, from which
the accompanying diagrams are drawn, were made for the
author by a very old gentleman who was himself once a flat-boatman
and used the Wabash horn.</p>

<p>This instrument is known as</p>


<h3>The Wabash Horn,</h3>

<p>(see illustration), for it was among the boatmen from that
river that it was always found.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 112.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Since the introduction of the house-boat as a popular
summer vacation boat, there is no reason why the Wabash
horn should not be rescued from the legends of the West
and hung under the eaves
of every American boy’s
house-boat, to be used to
summon the crew, as it was
in the good old times before
Fulton filled the waters
with his steam-boats and the
air with their ear-splitting
whistles.</p>

<p>The Wabash horn is one
of the most primitive affairs
possible; it is simply a long box, open at both ends, and differs
from an ordinary box in the fact that one end is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
much smaller than the opposite end; the big end is the bell
of the horn, and the small end is the part you put to your
lips.</p>


<h3>Among the Flat-boatmen</h3>

<p>these horns were made of pine, and sometimes they were as
much as eight feet long; but five or six feet will be long
enough for any ordinary boy.</p>

<p>Fig. 109 shows a six-foot slab, smoothed and trimmed
into proper form. It should be less than a quarter of an
inch thick, and made of red-wood, pine, or cedar, which is
free from knots, cracks, or blemishes of any kind. Make it
four or five inches wide at the big end and two inches wide
at the small end, outside measurement. See that the edges
are perfectly straight and true; otherwise your horn will
leak, and not only be difficult or impossible to blow, but if
you do succeed in making a noise with it the notes will be
flat and unpleasant. The other three slabs are of the same
form as the one described, but to make the openings square
two sides must be of dimensions given, and with the other
two you must allow for the thickness of the wood, and
make them just that much narrower than the first two
(Fig. 110).</p>


<h3>For a Mouth-piece,</h3>

<p>to fit the end of the horn, take a cedar block (Fig. 111) of
such dimensions that there will be no risk of splitting it
with an auger, and bore a hole through its centre, after
which it may be trimmed down to any required dimensions.
Next put three sides of your box together and fasten them
securely, with small brads.</p>

<p>You can now see the exact form of the small end, and
can whittle your cedar mouth-piece (Fig. 112) to fit the little
end of the box, and round off the protruding end, as shown
in the diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The diagrams of the block and mouth-piece are drawn
on a much larger scale than those of the slab and box, that
they may be better understood.</p>

<p>With a piece of sand-paper, wrapped around a pine stick,
sand-paper the hole in the cedar mouth-piece until it is
perfectly smooth. Put the mouth-piece in place, tack on
the remaining side to the box, and your Wabash horn is
finished.</p>

<p>You can now practise until you learn the bugle-calls,
and then hang it under the eaves of your boat, with a just
feeling of pride in the knowledge that you are not only a
boatman, and a modern wide-awake boy of to-day, but that
you lack neither the skill nor the self-reliance of the boy of
the day before yesterday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">THE AMERICAN BOY’S HOUSE-BOAT.</span></h2>


<p>When the great West of the United States began to
attract immigrants from the Eastern coast settlements, the
Ohio River rolled between banks literally teeming with all
sorts of wild game and wilder men: then it was that the
American house-boat had its birth.</p>

<p>The Mississippi, Ohio, and their tributaries furnished
highways for easy travel,
of which the daring pioneers
soon availed themselves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="300" height="113" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 113.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Lumber was to be had
for the labor of felling the
trees. From the borders of the Eastern plantations to the
prairies, and below the Ohio to the Mississippi, and from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, was one vast forest of
trees. Trees whose trunks were unscarred by the axe, and
whose tall tops reached an altitude which would hardly be
believed by those of this generation, who have only seen
second, third, or fourth-growth timber.</p>

<p>When the settlement of this new part of the country began
it was not long before each stream poured out, with its
own flood of water,</p>


<h3>A Unique Navy.</h3>

<p>There were keel-boats, built something like a modern
canal-boat, only of much greater dimensions; there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
broad-horns, looking like Noah’s arks from some
giant’s toy-shop, and there were flat-boats and
rafts, the latter with houses built on them, all
recklessly drifting, or being propelled by long
sweeps down the current into the great solemn,
unknown wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="600" height="472" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Bound for a Good Time.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Every island, had it a tongue, could tell of
wrecks; every point or headland, of adventure.</p>

<p>The perils were great and the forest solemn,
but the immigrants were merry, and the squeaking
fiddle made the red man rise up from his hiding-place
and look with wonder upon the “long
knives” and their squaws dancing on the decks
of their rude crafts, as they swept by into the
unknown.</p>

<p>The advent of the steam-boat gradually drove
the flat-boat, broadhorn, keel-boat, and all the
primitive sweep-propelled craft from the rivers,
but many of the old boatmen were loath to give
up so pleasant a mode of existence, and they built
themselves house-boats, and, still clinging to their
nomadic habits, took their wives, and went to
house-keeping on the bosom of the waters they
loved so well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 66px;">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="66" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 114.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Their descendants now form what might well
be called a race of river-dwellers, and to this day
their quaint little arks line the shores of the Mississippi
and its tributaries.</p>


<h3>Some of These House-Boats</h3>

<p>are as crudely made as the Italian huts we see
built along the railroads, but others are neatly
painted, and the interiors are like the proverbial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
New England homes, where everything is spick-and-span.</p>

<p>Like the drift-wood, these boats come down the stream
with every freshet, and whenever it happens that the waters
are particularly high they land at some promising spot and
earn a livelihood on the adjacent water, by fishing and working
aboard the other river-craft, or they land at some farming
district, and as the waters recede they prop up and
level their boats, on the bank, with stones or blocks of wood
placed under the lower corners of their homes.</p>

<p>The muddy waters, as they retire, leave a long stretch of
fertile land between the stranded house and the river, and
this space is utilized as a farm, where ducks, chickens, goats
and pigs are raised, and where garden-truck grows luxuriantly.</p>

<p>From a boat their home has been transformed to a farm-house;
but sooner or later there will be another big freshet,
and when the waters reach the late farm-house, lo! it is a
boat again, and goes drifting in its happy-go-lucky way
down the current. If it escapes the perils of snags and the
monster battering-rams, which the rapid current makes of
the drifting trees in the flood, it will land again, somewhere,
down-stream.</p>

<p>Lately, while on a sketching trip through Kentucky, I
was greatly interested in these boats, and on the Ohio
River I saw several making good headway against the
four-mile-an-hour current. This they did by the aid of</p>


<h3>Big Square Sails,</h3>

<p>spread on a mast planted near their bows, thus demonstrating
the practicability of the use of sails for house-boats.</p>

<p>The house-boats to be described in this article are much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
better adapted for sailing than any of the craft used by the
water-gypsies of the Western rivers.</p>

<p>For open and exposed waters, like the large lakes which
dot many of our inland States, or the Long Island Sound on
our coast, the following plans of the American boy’s house-boat
will have to be altered, but the alterations will be all
in the hull. If you make the hull three feet deep it will
have the effect of lowering the cabin, while the head-room
inside will remain the same. Such a craft can carry a good-sized
sail, and weather any gale you are liable to encounter,
even on the Sound, during the summer months.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="600" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 115.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Since the passing away of the glorious old flat-boat days,
idle people in England have introduced the</p>


<h3>House-Boat as a Fashionable Fad,</h3>

<p>which has spread to this country, and the boys now have a
new source of fun, as a result of this English fad.</p>

<p>There are still some nooks and corners left in every
State in the Union which the greedy pot-hunter and the devouring
saw-mill have as yet left undisturbed, and at such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
places the boy boatmen may “wind their horns,” as their
ancestors did of old, and have almost as good a time. But
first of all they must have a boat, and for convenience the
American boy’s house-boat will probably be found to excel
either a broadhorn or a flat-boat model, it being a link between
the two.</p>

<p>The simplest possible house-boat is a Crusoe raft,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with
a cabin near the stern and a sand-box for a camp-fire at the
bow. A good time can be had aboard even this primitive
craft. The next step in evolution is the long open scow,
with a cabin formed by stretching canvas over hoops that
reach from side to side of the boat (see Fig. 113).</p>

<p>Every boy knows how to build</p>


<h3>A Flat-Bottomed Scow,</h3>

<p>or at least every boy should know how to make as simple a
craft as the scow, but for fear some lad among my readers
has neglected this part of his education, I will give a few
hints which he may follow.</p>


<h3>Building Material.</h3>

<p>Select lumber that is free from large knots and other
blemishes. Keep the two best boards for the sides of your
boat. With your saw cut the side-boards into the form of
Fig. 114; see that they are exact duplicates. Set the two
pieces parallel to each other upon their straight or top
edges, as the first two pieces shown in Fig. 115. Nail on an
end-piece at the bow and stern, as the bumper is nailed in
Figs. 116 and 117; put the bottom on as shown in Fig. 115,
and you have a simple scow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Centre-Piece.</p>

<p>In Fig. 115 you will notice that there are two sides and
a centre-piece, but this centre-piece is not necessary for the
ordinary open boat, shown by Fig. 113. Here you have
one of the simple forms of house-boat, and you can make it
of dimensions to suit your convenience. I will not occupy
space with the details of this boat, because they may be
seen by a glance at the diagrams, and my purpose is to tell
you how to build the American boy’s house-boat, which
is a more elegant craft than the rude open scow, with a canvas-covered
cabin, shown by Fig. 113.</p>


<h3>The Sides of the House-Boat</h3>

<p>are 16 feet long, and to make them you need some sound
two-inch planks. After selecting the lumber plane it off
and make the edges true and straight. Each side and
the centre-piece should now measure exactly 16 feet in
length by 14 inches in width, and about 2 inches thick.
Cut off from each end of each piece a triangle, as shown by
the dotted lines at G, H, I (Fig. 114); from H to G is 1 foot,
and from H to I is 7 inches. Measure from H to I, 7 inches,
and mark the point. Then measure from H to G, 12 inches,
and mark the point. Then, with a carpenter’s pencil, draw
a line from G to I, and saw along this line. Keep the two
best planks for the sides of your boat, and use the one that
is left for the centre-piece. Measure 2 feet on the top or
straight edge of your centre-piece, and mark the point, A
(Fig. 114). From A measure 8 feet 10 inches, and mark the
point C (Fig. 114).</p>

<p>With a carpenter’s square rule the lines A, B and C, D,
and make them each 10 inches long, then rule the line, B,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
D (Fig. 114). The
piece A, B, C, D
must now be carefully
cut out; this
can be done by
using the saw to
cut A, B and D, C.
Then, about 6
inches from A,
saw another line of
the same length,
and with a chisel
cut the block out.
You then have
room to insert a
rip-saw, at B, and
can saw along the
line B, D until
you reach D,
when the piece
may be removed,
leaving the space
A, B, D, C for the
cabin of the boat
(see Figs. 116 and
117).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="321" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 116.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At a point 9
inches from the
bow of the boat
make a mark on
the centre-piece,
and another mark
5 inches farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
away, at F (Fig. 114). With the saw cut a slit at each mark,
1 inch deep, and with a chisel cut out, as shown by the dotted
lines; do the same at E, leaving a space of <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> feet between
the two notches, which are made to allow the two planks
shown in the plan (Fig. 116), to rest on. These planks support
the deck and the hatch, at the locker in the bow. The
notches at E and F are not on the side-boards, the planks
being supported at the sides by uprights, Figs. 116 and 117.</p>

<p>All that now remains to be done with the centre-piece is
to saw some three-cornered notches on bottom edge, one at
bow, one at stern, and one or two amidships; this is to allow
the water which may leak in to flow freely over the whole
bottom, and to prevent it from gathering at one side and
causing your craft to rest upon an uneven keel.</p>

<p>Next select a level piece of ground near by and arrange
the three pieces upon some supports, as shown in Fig. 115,
so that from outside to outside of side-pieces it will measure
just 8 feet across the bow and stern. Of 1-inch board</p>


<h3>Make Four End-Pieces,</h3>

<p>for the bow and stern (see A, A′, Fig. 115), to fit between
the sides and centre-piece. Make them each a trifle wider
than H, I, Fig. 114, so that after they have been fitted they
can be trimmed down with a plane, and bevelled on the same
slant as the bottom at G, I, Fig. 114. It being 8 feet between
the outside of each centre-piece, and the sides and the
centre-piece being each 2 inches thick, that gives us 8 feet - 6
inches, or <span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> feet as the combined length of A and A′
(Fig. 115). In other words, each end-piece will be half of
<span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> feet long&mdash;that is, 3 feet 9 inches long. After making
the four end-pieces, each 3 feet 9, by 9 inches, fit the ends in
place so that there is an inch protruding above and below.
See that your bow and stern are perfectly square, and nail
with wire nails through the sides into A and A′; toe-nail at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the centre-piece&mdash;that is, drive the nails from the broad side
of A and A′ slantingly, into the centre-piece, after which
trim down with your plane the projecting inch on bottom,
to agree with the slant of the bottom of the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="600" height="246" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 117.&mdash;Cross-Section of Boat.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Now for the Bottom.</h3>

<p>This is simple work. All that is necessary is to have
straight, true edges to your one-inch planks, fit them together,
and nail them in place. Of course, when you come
to the slant at bow and stern the bottom-boards at each end
will have to have a bevelled edge, to fit snugly against the
boards on the flat part of the bottom of the boat; but any
boy who is accustomed to shake the gray matter in his
brain can do this. Remember, scientists say that thought
is the agitation of the gray matter of the brain, and if you
are going to build a boat or play a good game of football
you must shake up that gray stuff, or the other boys will
put you down as a “stuff.” No boy can expect to be successful
in building a boat, of even the crudest type, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he keeps his wits about him, so I shall take it for granted
that there are no “stuffs” among my readers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_187.jpg" width="600" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 118.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After the boards are all snugly nailed on the bottom, and
fitted together so that there are no cracks to calk up, the
hull is ready to have</p>


<h3>The Bumpers</h3>

<p>nailed in place, at bow and stern. See the plan, Fig. 116,
and the elevation, Fig. 117. The bumpers must be made
of 2-inch plank, 8 feet long by about 9 inches wide; wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
enough to cover A and A´ of Fig. 115, and to leave room
for a bevel at the bottom edge to meet the slant of the
bow and stern, and still have room at the top to cover the
edge of the deck to the hull (see Fig. 117).</p>


<h3>The Hull May Now be Painted,</h3>

<p>with two coats of good paint, and after it is dry may be
turned over and allowed to rest on a number of round
sticks, called rollers.</p>

<p>If you will examine Fig. 116 you will see there</p>


<h3>Twenty-odd Ribs.</h3>

<p>These are what are called two-by-fours&mdash;that is, 2 inches
thick by 4 inches wide. They support the floor of the
cabin and forward locker, at the same time adding strength
to the hull.</p>

<p>The ribs are each the same length as the end-board, A and
A´ of Fig. 115, and are nailed in place in the same manner.
Each bottom-rib must have a notch 2 inches deep cut in
the bottom edge to allow the free passage of water, so as to
enable you to pump dry. Commencing at the stern, the
distance between the inside of the bumper and the first
rib is 1 foot 6 inches. This is a deck-rib, as may be seen by
reference to Figs. 116 and 117. After measuring <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> feet
from the bumper, on inside of side-board, mark the point
with a carpenter’s pencil. Measure the same distance on
the centre-piece, and mark the point as before; then carefully
fit your rib in flush or even with the top of the side-piece,
and fasten it in place by nails driven through the side-board
into the end of the rib, and toe-nailed to centre-piece.
Do the same with its mate on the other side of centre-piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Cabin of this House-Boat</h3>

<p>is to fit in the space, A, B, D, C of the centre-piece,
Fig. 114. There is to be a 1-inch plank at each end (see
Fig. 117), next to which the side-supports at each end of
cabin fit. The supports are two-by-twos; so, allowing 1
inch for the plank and 2 inches for the upright support, the
next pair of ribs will be just 3 inches from A B, Fig. 114,
of the centre-piece (see Figs. 116 and 117). The twin ribs
at the forward end of the cabin will be the same distance
from D C, Fig. 114, as shown in the plan and elevation,
Figs. 116 and 117. This leaves five pairs of ribs to be distributed
between the front and back end of the cabin.
From the outside of each end-support to the inside of the
nearest middle-support is 2 feet 6 inches. Allowing 2 inches
for the supports, this will place the adjoining ribs 2 feet 8
inches from the outside of the end-supports. The other
ribs are placed midway between, as may be seen by the elevation,
Fig. 117.</p>

<p>There is another pair of</p>


<h3>Deck-Ribs</h3>

<p>at the forward end of the cabin, which are placed flush with
the line D, C, Fig. 114 (see Figs. 116 and 117). The two pairs
of ribs in the bow are spaced, as shown in the diagram.
This description may appear as if it was a complicated
affair; but you will find it a simple thing to work out if you
will remember to allow space for your pump in the stern,
space for the end-planks at after and forward end of cabin,
and space for your uprights. The planks at after and forward
end of cabin are to box in the cabin floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Boat May Now be Launched</h3>

<p>by sliding it over the rollers, which will not be found a
difficult operation.</p>


<h3>The Plans Show Three Lockers</h3>

<p>&mdash;two in the bow under the hatch and one under the rear
bunk&mdash;but if it is deemed necessary the space between-decks,
at each side of the cabin, may be utilized as lockers.
In this space you can store enough truck to last for months.
A couple of doors in the plank at the front of the cabin
opening, under the deck, will be found very convenient to
reach the forward locker in wet weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Keel</h3>

<p>is a triangular piece of 2-inch board, made to fit exactly in
the middle of the stern, and had best be nailed in place before
the boat is launched (see Fig. 117). The keel must
have its bottom edge flush with the bottom of the boat, and
a strip of hard-wood nailed on the stern-end of the keel
and bumper, as shown in the diagram. A couple of strong
screw-eyes will support the rudder.</p>

<p>After the boat is launched the</p>


<h3>Side-Supports for the Cabin May be Erected.</h3>

<p>These are “two-by-twos” and eight in number, and
each 5 feet 9 inches long. Nail them securely at their lower
ends to the adjoining ribs. See that they are plumb, and
fasten them temporarily with diagonal pieces, to hold the
top ends in place, while you nail down the lower deck or
flooring.</p>

<p>Now fit and nail the two 1-inch planks in place, at the
bow and stern-end of the cabin, each of which has its top
one inch above the sides, even with the proposed deck (see
dotted lines in Fig. 117).</p>


<h3>Use Ordinary Flooring,</h3>

<p>or if that is not obtainable use <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>-inch pine boards, and run
them lengthwise from the bow to the front end of the
cabin and along the sides of the cabin. Then floor the
cabin lengthwise from bow to stern. This gives you a dry
cabin floor, for there are 4 inches of space underneath for
bilge water, which unless your boat is badly made and very
leaky, is plenty of room for what little water may leak in
from above or below. The two side-boards of the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
floor must, of course, have square places neatly cut out to
fit the uprights of the cabin. This may be done by slipping
the floor-board up against the uprights and carefully marking
the places with a pencil where they will come through
the board, and then at each mark sawing two inches in the
floor plank, and cutting out the blocks with a chisel.</p>


<h3>The Hatch.</h3>

<p>Now take a “four-by-four” and saw off eight short supports
for the two 1-inch planks which support the hatch,
Figs. 116 and 117. Toe-nail the middle four-by-four to the
floor in such a position that the two cross-planks (which are
made to fit in the notches E and F, Fig. 114) will rest on
the supports. Nail the four other supports to the side-boards
of your boat, and on top of these nail the cross-planks,
as shown in the diagrams.</p>

<p>The boat is now ready for its</p>


<h3>Upper Deck</h3>

<p>of 1-inch pine boards. These are to be nailed on lengthwise,
bow and stern and at sides of cabin, leaving, of course,
the cabin open, as shown by the position of the boys in Fig.
117, and an opening, 3 feet by 2, for the hatch (Fig. 116).
The two floors will act as benches for the uprights of the
cabin, and hold them stiff and plumb.</p>

<p>To further stiffen the frame, make two diagonals for the
stern-end, as shown in Fig. 118, and nail them in place.</p>


<h3>The Rafters,</h3>

<p>or roof-rods, should extend a foot each way beyond the
cabin, hence cut them two feet longer than the cabin, and
after testing your uprights, to see that they are exactly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
plumb, nail the two side roof-rods in place (see dotted lines
in Fig. 117). The cross-pieces at the ends, as they support
no great weight, may be fitted between
the two side-rods, and nailed
there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="300" height="384" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 120.&mdash;Inside View of Door.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The roof is to be made of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>-inch
boards bent into a curve, and
the ridge-pole, or centre roof-rod,
must have some support.
This is obtained by two short pieces
of 2-by-4, each 6 inches long, which
are toe-nailed to the centre of each
cross-rod, and the ridge-pole nailed
to their tops. At 3 feet from the
upper deck the side frame-pieces
are toe-nailed to the uprights. As
may be seen, there are three two-by-fours
on each side (Fig. 117).</p>

<p>The space between the side
frame-pieces, the two middle uprights,
and side roof-rods, is where the windows are to be
placed.</p>

<p>Use <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>-inch (tongue and groove preferred) pine boards
for sidings, and</p>


<h3>Box in your Cabin</h3>

<p>neatly, allowing space for windows on each side, as indicated.
Leave the front open. Of the same kind of boards
make your roof; the boards being light you can bend them
down upon each side and nail them to the side roof-rods,
forming a pretty curve, as may be seen in the illustration
of the American boy’s house-boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<h3>This Roof,</h3>

<p>to be finished neatly and made entirely water-proof, should
be covered with tent-cloth or light canvas, smoothly
stretched over and tacked upon the under side of the projecting
edges. Three good coats of paint will make it
water-proof and pleasant to look upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="150" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 121.&mdash;Side-View
of Door.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The description, so far, has been for a
neatly finished craft, but I have seen very
serviceable and comfortable house-boats
built of rough lumber, in which case the
curved roof, when they had one, had narrow
strips nailed over the boards where
they joined each other.</p>


<h3>To Contrive a Movable Front</h3>

<p>to your cabin, make two doors to fit and
close the front opening, but in place of
hanging the doors on hinges, set them in
place. Each door should have a good
strong strap nailed securely on the inside,
for a handle, and a batten or cross-piece at
top and bottom of inside surface. A two-by-four,
run parallel to the front top cross-frame
and nailed there, just a sufficient
distance from it to allow the top of the
door to be inserted between, will hold the top of the
door securely. A two-by-four, with bolt-holes near either
end to correspond with bolt-holes in the floor, will hold
the bottom when the door is pushed in place, the movable
bottom-piece shoved against it and the bolts thrust in
(see Fig. 120, view from inside of cabin. Fig. 121, side-view).
It will be far less work to break in the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
cabin than to burst in such doors, if they are well made.
These doors possess this advantage: they can be removed
and used as table-tops, leaving the whole front open to the
summer breeze, or one may be removed, and still allow
plenty of ventilation. A moulding on deck around the
cabin is not necessary, but it will add finish and prevent
the rain-water from leaking in.</p>

<p>To lock up the boat you must set the doors from the
inside, and if you wish to leave the craft locked you must
crawl out of the window and fasten the latter with a padlock.</p>

<p>Fig. 122 shows the construction of</p>


<h3>The Rudder,</h3>

<p>and also an arrangement by which it may be worked from
the front of the boat, which, when the boat is towed, will
be found most convenient.</p>

<p>The hatch should be made of 1-inch boards, to fit snugly
flush with the deck, as in the illustration, or made of 2-inch
plank, and a moulding fitted around the opening, as shown
in Fig. 117.</p>


<h3>A Pair of Rowlocks,</h3>

<p>made of two round oak sticks with an iron rod in their
upper ends, may be placed in holes in the deck near the
bow, and the boat can be propelled by two oarsmen using
long “sweeps,” which have holes at the proper places to
fit over the iron rods projecting from the oaken rowlocks.
These rowlocks may be removed when not in use, and the
holes closed by wooden plugs, while the sweeps can be
hung at the side of the cabin, under its eaves, or lashed
fast to the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>


<h3>Two or more Ash Poles,</h3>

<p>for pushing or poling the boat over shallow water or other
difficult places for navigation are handy, and should not be
left out of the equipment. The window-sashes may be
hung on hinges and supplied with hooks and screw-eyes
to fasten them open by hooking them to the eaves when
it is desired to let in the fresh air, as shown in the illustration
of the finished boat.</p>

<p>Two bunks can be fitted at the rear end of the cabin,
one above the other, the bottom bunk being the lid to a
locker (see Fig. 117).</p>


<h3>The Locker</h3>

<p>is simply a box, the top of which is just below the deck-line
and extending the full width of the cabin. It has
hinges at the back, and may be opened for the storage of
luggage.</p>

<p>Over the lid blankets are folded, making a divan during
the day and a bed at night.</p>

<p>The top bunk is made like the frame of a cheap cot,
but in place of being upholstered it has a strong piece of
canvas stretched across it. This bunk is also hinged to the
back of the cabin, so that when not in use it can be swung
up against the roof and fastened there as the top berth in a
sleeping-car is fastened. Four 4-by-4 posts can be bolted
to the side-support at each corner of the bottom bunk;
they will amply support the top bunk, as the legs do a
table-top when the frame is allowed to rest upon their
upper ends. This makes accommodation for two boys,
and there is still room for upper and lower side bunks, the
cabin being but six feet wide. If you put bunks on both
sides you will be rather crowded, it is true, but by allowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a 1-foot passage in the middle, you can have two side
bunks and plenty of head room. This will accommodate
four boys, and that is a full crew for a boat of this size.</p>

<p>On board a yacht I have often seen four full-grown men
crowded into a smaller space in the cabin, while the sailormen
in the fo’castle had not near that amount of breathing-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 122.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Figs. 118, 119, and 120 show</p>


<h3>A More Simple Set of Plans.</h3>

<p>Here the cabin is built on top of the upper deck, and
there are no bottom-ribs, the uprights being held in place
by blocks nailed to the bottom of the boat, and by the deck
of the boat. This is secure enough for well-protected
waters, small lakes, and small streams. Upon the inland
streams of New York State I have seen two-story house-boats,
the cabin, or house, being only a frame-work covered
with canvas. One such craft I saw in central New York,
drifting down-stream over a shallow riff, and as it bumped
along over the stones it presented a strange sight. The
night was intensely dark, and the boat brightly lighted.
The lights shone through the canvas covering, and this big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
luminous house went bobbing over the shallow water, while
shouts of laughter and the “plinky-plunk” of a banjo told
in an unmistakable manner of the jolly time the crew were
having.</p>


<h3>Canvas-Cabined House-Boat.</h3>

<p>If you take an ordinary open scow and erect a frame of
uprights and cross-pieces, and cover it with canvas, you will
have just such a boat as the one seen in central New York.
This boat may be propelled by oars, the rowers sitting under
cover, and the canvas being lifted at the sides to allow the
sweeps to work; but of course it will not be as snug as the
well-made American boy’s house-boat, neither can it stand
the same amount of rough usage, wind, and rain as the latter
boat.</p>

<p>In the illustration the reader will notice a stove-pipe at
the stern; there is room for a small stove back of the cabin,
and in fair weather it is much better to cook outside than
inside the cabin. When you tie up to the shore for any
length of time, a rude shelter of boughs and bark will make
a good kitchen on the land, in which the stove may be
placed, and you will enjoy all the fun of a camp, with the
advantage of a snug house to sleep in.</p>

<p>For the benefit of boys who doubt their ability to build
a boat of this description, it may be well to state that other
lads have used these directions and plans with successful
results, and their boats now gracefully float on many waters,
a source of satisfaction and pride to their owners.</p>


<h3>Information for Old Boys.</h3>

<p>On all the Western rivers small flat-boats or scows are
to be had at prices which vary in accordance with the mercantile
instincts of the purchaser, and with the desire of the
seller to dispose of his craft. Such boats are propelled by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
“sweeps,” a name used to designate the long poles with
boards on their outer edges that serve as blades and form
the oars. These boats are often supplied with a deck-house,
extending almost from end to end, and if such a house is
lacking one may be built with little expense. The cabin
may be divided into rooms and the sleeping apartments supplied
with cheaply made bunks. It is not the material of
the bunk which makes it comfortable&mdash;it is the mattress in
the bunk upon which your comfort will depend. The
kitchen and dining-room may be all in one. An awning
spread over the roof will make a delightful place in which
to lounge and catch the river breezes.</p>


<h3>The Cost of House-Boats.</h3>

<p>The cost of a ready-made flat-bottomed house-boat is
anywhere from thirty dollars to one or more thousands. In
Florida such a boat, 40 by 20 feet, built for the quiet waters
of the St. John’s River or its tributaries, or the placid
lagoons, will cost eight hundred dollars. This boat is well
painted outside and rubbed down to a fine oil finish inside;
it has one deck, and the hull is used for toilet apartments
and state-rooms; the hull is well calked and all is in good
trim. Such expense is, however, altogether unnecessary&mdash;there
need be no paint or polish. All you need is a well-calked
hull and a water-tight roof of boards or canvas
overhead; cots or bunks to sleep in; chairs, stools, boxes or
benches to sit on; hammocks to loll in, and a good supply
of provisions in the larder.</p>

<p>House-boats for the open waters are necessarily more
expensive. As a rule they need round bottoms that stand
well out of the water, and are built like the hull of a ship.
These boats cost as much to build as a small yacht. From
twelve to fifteen hundred dollars will build a good house-boat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with comfortable sleeping-berths, toilet-rooms, and
store-rooms below; a kitchen, dining-room and living-room
on the cabin deck, with wide, breezy passageways separating
them.</p>

<p>If a bargain can be found in an old schooner with a good
hull, for two or three hundred dollars, a first-class house-boat
can be made by the expenditure of as much more for a
cabin. The roofs of all house-boats should extend a foot
or more beyond the sides of the cabin.</p>


<h3>For People of Limited Means.</h3>

<p>For people with little money to spend, these expensive
boats are as much out of reach as a yacht, but they may
often be rented for prices within the means of people in
moderate circumstances. At New York I have known a
good schooner-yacht, 84 feet over all, to be chartered for
two weeks, with crew of skipper and two men, the larder
plentifully supplied with provisions and luxuries for six
people and the crew, making nine in all, at a cost of thirty-six
dollars apiece for each of the six passengers. An
equally good house-boat should not cost over twelve dollars
a week per passenger for a party of ten. In inland waters,
if a boat could be rented, the cost should not exceed seven
or eight dollars a week per passenger.</p>

<p>A canal-boat is a most excellent house-boat for a pleasure
party, either on inland streams or along our coast.</p>


<h3>Street-Car Cabins.</h3>

<p>Since the introduction of cable and trolley cars the
street-car companies have been selling their old horse-cars,
in some instances at figures below the cost of the window-glass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in them; so cheap, in fact, that poor people buy them
to use as woodsheds and chicken-coops.</p>

<p>One of these cars will make an ideal cabin for a house-boat,
and can be adapted for that purpose with little or no
alterations. All it needs is a good flat-boat to rest in, and
you have a palatial house-boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A BACK-YARD SWITCHBACK.</span></h2>


<p>The back-yard affords an opportunity to build a summer
toboggan slide, or its equivalent, commonly known as a</p>


<h3>“Switchback,”</h3>

<p>the difference being that, in place of toboggans, cars are
used, and in place of ice and snow you coast down a railroad
track.</p>


<h3>The Wheels</h3>

<p>of the back-yard “switchback” car must be made of thick,
sound wood, and if there is a wood-working factory in your
neighborhood it will save you time and trouble to go there
and have the wheels sawed out with the machinery which
they have built for that kind of work. But if you must do
it yourself, then select a piece of two-inch plank, and after
driving a tack in the centre, fasten a string to the tack and
attach a soft pencil to the opposite end of the string. With
this describe a circle about nine inches in diameter, or
measuring about four and a half inches from the tack to the
pencil.</p>

<p>With a hand-saw roughly cut out the wheel, using great
care to only touch the circle with the saw, but in no case to
cut through the circumference. You will now have an irregular
wheel, with a number of flat surfaces for its edge
(Fig. 123 A).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way you may continue to saw off the triangular
corners until you reduce the wheel to a condition where it
only needs the application of a sharp knife to round the
edge until it corresponds with the pencil circle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="600" height="504" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 123-126.&mdash;The Wheel.</p></div>
</div>

<p>What is called</p>


<h3>The Flange</h3>

<p>of the wheel is practically another wheel, made of thinner
material (Fig. 124), which is securely nailed to the first
wheel (Figs. 125 and 126), with the grain of the wood of
the flange crossing the grain of the wood of the wheel
proper at right angles. The flange is made of one-inch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
board, and to prevent its splitting is reënforced by a strip
of wood fastened on across the grain, with screws, as shown
in Fig. 124.</p>

<p>When the four wheels are finished, and a hole large
enough for a good strong axle is bored in the exact centre
of each, you will be ready to begin work upon the car.</p>


<h3>Set the Car-Bed Low.</h3>

<p>The smallest boy will understand that the lower the bed
of the car is put the less the danger of an upset, so instead
of putting the axle, under
the car, run them through
the bed, as shown by Fig.
128.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="300" height="218" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 127 and 128.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Build the Axles</h3>

<p>of four-by-four timber, and
by the aid of a drawing-knife
or a good, strong,
sharp jack-knife, trim off
the ends of the timber to
the form shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>When the ends are small enough to allow the wheels
to revolve freely, saw out places in the side-boards of the
car (Figs. 127 and 128), into which the square part of the
axle will snugly fit.</p>


<h3>The Bottom of the Car</h3>

<p>may be made of half-inch boards, which can be joined and
nailed on to the car, with their irregular ends protruding,
after which, with a hand-saw, cut off the ends even with the
side-boards, as in Fig. 129.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Then nail in place the head and tail-boards, and in the
same manner saw off their protruding ends, even with the
side-boards (Fig. 129). To finish your car it is only necessary
to slip the wheels upon the axles. The wheels may
be held in place by pegs of hard-wood driven through
holes in the hub, made for that purpose, as shown in Fig.
130. You will then have a car, but no track to run it upon.
However, if you build the toboggan slide which is described
in the next chapter, you may lay rails, made of two-by-four
timber, down your toboggan slide and thus transform
it into a back-yard “switchback.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 129 and 130.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But if you have no toboggan slide you will have to build
a tramway for your car against the back fence, wood-shed,
or any other suitable place.</p>

<p>In the diagram (Fig. 135) here given, the slide is shown
as it would be if built against the back fence, extending
forward through the middle of the yard. But you must
have a</p>


<h3>Starting Platform.</h3>

<p>You will need four pieces of timber, seven feet long and
two inches thick by four inches wide, for the uprights or
corner-posts (A and B, Fig. 131), unless the posts and rails
of the back fence are on your side of the yard, as in Fig. 132.
In this case you need only two seven-foot sticks and two
short ones, to fit on the top rail of the fence. The tops of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
these short posts should be just seven feet from the ground.
Nail them securely in place, about five feet apart, as in Fig.
132, and then see that the fence-boards, to which the posts
are nailed, are secure. If they are not secure, climb over
the fence and put in a few good wire nails, for if the fence
is not strong your structure will be weak. Additional
strength may be gained by making each of the uprights of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
two pieces of two-by-four, nailed together, thus making the
posts four-by-four.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="600" height="612" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 131.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 132.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a good plan to erect one of the posts directly over
one of the fence-posts; this will add strength and stiffness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to the structure. If you have any doubts about the ability
of the fence to support the platform, erect two seven-foot
posts, as in Fig. 131, and spike them to the top and bottom
rail of the fence. Next take two pieces of two-by-four and
notch them, as E and F are notched in Fig. 133. Nail F to
the top of A and B, and E to the ends of C and D, the two
seven-foot posts of two-by-four. Near the other ends of
these last posts nail a cross-piece (G, Fig. 133), and then, to
stiffen the frame, turn it over and nail on two diagonal pieces
of lighter material.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Erect this frame about five or six feet from the fence and
secure it in place by the two diagonals, H and H (Fig. 133),
which are nailed near the top of C and D, and “toe-nailed”
to the bottom rail of the fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>From the bottom rail of the fence, and level with it, run
the two J pieces of board to C and D, and nail them securely,
as in Fig. 134; then nail on the two top side-pieces, K
and K, and the framework of the starting platform is ready
for its floor. Nail boards across the top, from E to F, and
saw off the protruding ends, as in Fig. 134.</p>

<h3>The Track</h3>

<p>must be a “straight-away,” which means no curves to round,
hence you must build it in the position which will give
the longest run for your trouble.</p>


<h3>A Curved Track</h3>

<p>means more difficult work on the tramway and cars, for the
car must have a movable axle in order to be able to round
the curve. But with a straight track the play of the wheel
upon the hub should allow enough freedom of motion to
overcome the little inaccuracy which may occur in the rails.
Experiment will teach you just what is needed. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
give exact rules, because the material and location will
differ with each builder, and I have found that when I
give positive rules, the rules are followed, even when the
material and location are entirely unsuited to the directions
given. For this reason it is best for each boy to experiment
for himself.</p>


<h3>Erect the Uprights</h3>

<p>first, and brace them with the diagonal boards, as shown in
the diagram (Fig. 135). When you are certain the structure
is firm and can stand the strain and weight of a loaded car,
lay the two-by-four rails upon the ground, and fit them to
the car-wheels by pushing the car over them, to see that
they are just the right distance apart. If you make your
track too wide the car-wheels will slip off the rails and run
between them, and if you lay your track with too narrow
a gauge the rails will pinch the flanges of the wheels so
tightly that the car will stop, or the rails spread.</p>

<p>When one section of the track is laid and it is found
that the car runs freely upon it, nail cross-ties of ordinary
boards across from rail to rail, like a ladder. Then take
the ladder, and turning it over so that the rails are on top
(Fig. 136), adjust it to the tramway (Fig. 135), and fasten it
securely, by nailing the cross-ties to the side-boards of the
tramway.</p>

<p>In Fig. 135</p>


<h3>The Cross-ties, or Sleepers,</h3>

<p>are put in position, to show how they will look when the
track is laid, but in reality the cross-ties must be nailed to
the rails while the latter are upon the level ground, as I
have already stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>When each section of track is fastened in place, from
the top of the tramway to the ground, and as much farther
as your space or lumber will admit, load your car with
stones, or some equally heavy freight, and start it down the
“switchback.”</p>

<p>If the car reaches its journey’s end with no mishap, you
can with safety get in the car for the next trip and coast
down yourself and a jolly good coast it will be.</p>

<p>The plans (Figs. 135 and 136) may be altered so that the
car will run down one hill and mount another not quite so
high, and many other improvements will suggest themselves
to the young civil engineers who build this “switchback,”
but the first track you erect should be as simple as is consistent
with strength and safety, and the improvements left
to some future time.</p>


<h3>Ticket-Chopper’s Box.</h3>

<p>You may then take a square box, with a lock and key
attached, and bore a hole in one end large enough to admit a
good-sized marble; use this as the railroad and ferry-men
use a ticket-chopper’s box, let every boy who wants a ride
drop a marble in the box.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago a certain boy built a “switchback”
in his back-yard, very much like the one here described,
and great fun he had with it; but as he was not rich, and the
lumber cost him something, he issued a number of tickets at
one cent each, every ticket entitling the holder to three
rides on the “switchback.” In this way he was soon repaid
all the expense he had been under during the erection of his
wonderful railroad.</p>

<p>This is what that boy told the writer, and as the former
young engineer is now no longer a lad, but a grave D.D.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who wears solemn black clothes and preaches long sermons,
the writer believes him.</p>

<img src="images/i_213.jpg" width="468" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Under Full Headway.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But whether you charge a cent, a marble, or nothing, for
a ride, you and your friends are bound to have a rollicking
good time on the back-yard “switchback.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO BUILD A TOBOGGAN-SLIDE IN THE
BACK-YARD.</span></h2>


<p>Toboggans and sleds are not always used on snow and
ice, neither is coasting confined to winter weather.</p>

<p>At most of the summer resorts you may coast down an
artificial hill, upon real toboggans, over a slide of hard-wood
rollers, and end with a whoop and a splash in the water of
the bathing-pool.</p>


<h3>Slipperies.</h3>

<p>All through the southwestern part of this country the
summer drought causes the rivers to subside, leaving more
or less high mud or clay banks, which are utilized by the
youngsters as mud-slides, and called by them “slipperies.”
The boys use neither sled nor toboggan, but make a slide
by pouring water over the dry mud until they have a long,
slippery track, down which they coast, ending with a splash
in the river.</p>


<h3>A War-Time Slippery.</h3>

<p>A good many years ago a battalion of Union soldiers
were camped on the river-bank, near where some Kentucky
boys were having fun on a long slippery, and one day, before
the lads knew what had happened, two thousand naked
men suddenly made their appearance, jostling each other,
for a slide down the mud-track. It was a great sight to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
see these men-children coasting down the mud-bank, and
the show the soldiers made for them repaid the boys for
their labor in building the slide.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="600" height="372" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 138.&mdash;The Toboggan-Slide.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Tropical Toboggan-Slide.</h3>

<p>Under the torrid zone, away out on the Islands of the
Pacific Ocean, the natives coast down-hill, in the hottest
weather, on the dry grass, and where that does not
exist they build themselves toboggan-slides, with slabs of
smooth lava. Hundreds of these tracks line the mountain-sides
near the native villages. The sled these daring
coasters use is from seven to twenty feet long, and as narrow
in proportion as a shell-boat, there being only a few
inches of space between the very hard, polished wooden
runners. It takes both skill and pluck to ride one of these
cranky tropical sleds, or toboggans, but the natives possess
both of these qualities, and without a thought of failure
pick up their primitive machine, take a short, swift run,
and throw the sled and themselves together, headlong down
the lava-slide. There follows a wildly exciting and breathless
ride down the incline, and a scoot over the level country,
until gradually the queer sled slows up and comes to a
stop; and then there is a long climb back, for another daring
coast to the quiet valley below.</p>

<p>In the United States we have no smooth lava with which
to build slides on our native hills, and if we did have the
lava-slides only a few of our boys would have an opportunity
to use them.</p>

<p>When the snow covers the ground it is not every boy
who can find a convenient hill where he may enjoy the
healthful fun of coasting. A great many boys live in a level
country, and hundreds and thousands of others have their
homes in cities and towns, where heavy carts, policemen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and trolley-cars, make coasting a forbidden pleasure. However,
with a real toboggan-slide in the back-yard, a boy may
snap his fingers at a level country, lumbering carts, death-dealing
cars, and meddlesome guardians of the peace.</p>

<p>In a day’s time three boys can build a slide; but, of
course, it cannot be built without some labor. If it could,
it would be of no value. The labor consists only in sawing
a few pieces of timber and driving a few nails to hold the
frame together, and it is effort well-spent.</p>


<h3>If Your Back-Yard is Wide</h3>

<p>enough you can run the toboggan-track alongside the back
fence, with the starting platform built in the fence-corner,
backing against the side fence. In this way your slide will
occupy but little space.</p>


<h3>But if Your Yard is Long and Narrow,</h3>

<p>build your platform against the back fence (as described in
Chapter XIV.), and let the track run along one of the side
fences.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of the work is now finished.
Make</p>


<h3>A Frame,</h3>

<p>on the pattern of C, E, D, G (<a href="#frame">Figs. 133 and 134, Chapter
XIV.</a>), and about half the height of the platform (see L,
M, N, Fig. 138).</p>

<p>Erect this frame in front of the platform, and at such a
distance from it as will allow your longest boards to span
the intervening space, as in Fig. 138. Nail two diagonals&mdash;one
at each top end of the frame M, L, N, and fasten the
opposite ends of the diagonals to the bottoms of C and D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Long boards may be laid from the ground to the top of
M, N, L, and nailed securely to the frame, and other boards
laid over the upper ends of the first, and the top of E, where
they can be securely nailed, and the slide is ready for use.</p>


<h3>The Incline May be Lengthened</h3>

<p>by using a carpenter’s wooden horse for another frame, and
allowing the boards from the ground to rest on this, and
another set of boards run from this to L, M, N, as in Fig.
138, or as described for the switchback, in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>With plenty of snow on the ground it will not hurt a
strong boy to fall from this track. But there may not be
much snow on the hard, frozen ground, or your little
brothers and sisters may be fond of coasting. To prevent
any mishap, a guard-rail, such as is shown on one side of the
slide in Fig. 138, should be nailed on each side of the inclined
plane, as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>The posts for the railing around the platform are “toe-nailed”
to the floor, and the rail is nailed on top of them.
In case the rail seems weak, a diagonal or two, like those on
the slide-frames, will make it sufficiently strong.</p>


<h3>A Toboggan Room.</h3>

<p>By boarding up around the posts, under the platform, a
small room will be made, at a trifling additional cost and
labor, which can be kept warm, and will afford a means of
shelter and a place to lock up the sleds.</p>

<p>An excellent plan for</p>


<h3>“Packing” the Slide, or Chute,</h3>

<p>is to mix sawdust and snow together, in equal parts, using
just enough water to cause it to pack solidly, as a foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for the top crust of snow or ice. This foundation will
make the top ice or snow last much longer, in thawing
weather, than it would if spread directly on the wooden bed
of the slide. If the snow in the chute is properly and
smoothly banked up on this composition foundation, moistened
and frozen hard, with the addition of half an inch of
fresh snow on top, the slide, in ordinary weather, will last
all winter.</p>


<h3>It is a Wise Plan</h3>

<p>to be ready for any emergency. You may have visitors
who come without sleds, and who would have but a chilly
time watching the others coast down the wonderful toboggan-slide.
To prevent the chance of any such disagreeable
occurrences, knock an old barrel to pieces and build yourself
a supply of toboggans with the staves. Two barrel-staves,
fastened together by a cross-bar in front and a piece
of board for a seat in the rear, will make a most excellent
toboggan.</p>

<p>The boy in the foreground of Fig. 138 is building toboggans
of barrel staves, and a glance at this cut will tell you
how they are made.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A HOME-MADE CIRCUS.</span></h2>


<p>To the typical American boy every object he sees suggests
to him possibilities of amusement, and to him an up-to-date
bath-room is as full of such suggestions as a dictionary
is of words. The great white tub affords an excellent
sea for his gun-boats to do battle upon, or offers a straight-away
course over which his home-made yachts may sail,
while a fan fills their sails with everything from a light
breeze to a ripping gale.</p>

<p>What boy has not discovered, for himself, that</p>


<h3>The Bath-tub is a Splendid Receiving-Tank</h3>

<p>for the occasional water-animals captured by him in creek
or pond, or at the fish-market?</p>

<p>The laundry tubs are also useful and, not being in demand
as frequently as the bath-tub, are for this reason often
more convenient.</p>

<p>If the grown people would only let the bath-room alone,
there is no end to the fun which an ingenious lad could
have in that useful little room.</p>


<h3>As a Lake for His Fleet,</h3>

<p>and as a receiving-tank for his water-pets are only two of
the uses which the bath-tub suggests to a bright boy.
When he sees the faucet he realizes that this can afford him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
power for all sorts of machinery, if he can arrange a water-wheel
under it to transmit the power.</p>

<p>Every country boy knows how to make water-wheels,
and every summer the springs and brooks all over the
land turn these little wheels in exactly the same manner
which the larger streams turn the big wheels for the factories
and mills on their banks.</p>

<p>But there are thousands of boys in our great cities who
have never seen</p>


<h3>A Water-wheel,</h3>

<p>and for the use of these boys the accompanying illustrations
were drawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="600" height="188" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 139-141.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 139 shows a four-sided soft-pine stick, with square
ends, and if you have a good sharp knife it requires but
little work to trim off the four edges of this stick until it
has the form of a six-sided lead-pencil (Fig. 140), after which
but little skill is required to whittle the ends down to the
size of the hole in a thread-spool (Fig. 141).</p>


<h3>The Shaft.</h3>

<p>You will see, on examining the illustration, that the
middle is left with the six sides untouched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>


<h3>An Old Cigar-Box</h3>

<p>will not only furnish you with excellent wood for the paddles
of your wheels (Fig. 142), but, if carefully taken apart,
it will also furnish you with just the right sort of nails with
which to fasten your paddles to the shaft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_227a.jpg" width="600" height="119" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 142.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Make Six Paddles,</h3>

<p>all of the same size and same pattern, and nail one to one of
the six sides of the shaft (Fig. 142).</p>

<p>Turn the shaft around to the next face or side, and nail
another paddle in place; continue this work until you have
the paddle-wheel shown in Fig. 143.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_227b.jpg" width="600" height="191" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 143.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On to one or both ends of the shaft you may now slip
wooden spools, pushing them up the stick until they fit
tightly, and leave a projecting end of the shaft sticking
out of the end of the spool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<h3>Hanging-Bars.</h3>

<p>Next take a lath or stick of some kind, which is of such
length that it will rest securely when laid across from side
to side of the bath-tub. To this stick tack two others, as
shown in Fig. 144.</p>

<p>These hanging-bars must be long enough to allow
the water-wheel to be suspended just below the faucet of
the bath-tub. Strengthen your hanging-bars (Fig. 144) by
two diagonal pieces.</p>

<p>Fig. 145 shows how to cut a notch near the lower end of
one hanging-bar, and a hole is bored near the end of the
opposite hanging-bar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="600" height="431" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 144 and 145.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To adjust the wheel, place the top bar across the bath-tub
and then slip the shaft in the hole in the hanging-bar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sliding the other end of the shaft into the slot shown in
Fig. 145.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/i_229.jpg" width="419" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 146-149.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the water is now allowed to run slowly from the
faucet and fall upon the inside paddles it will set the
wheel in motion, and this motion can be transmitted to any
small and simple piece of machinery by means of a belt
running from the spool which is attached to the wheel to
a similar spool, attached to the machine.</p>

</div>


<h3>If you Make a Frame,</h3>

<p>similar to that which holds the water-wheel, (Fig. 144) and
make it with much shorter hanging-bars, it will not be
necessary to support them with the diagonal pieces. This
second frame can be reversed over the first frame, so that
the hanging-bars will set upright upon the cross-bar, and
when in that position a small horizontal bar may be made
to revolve by connecting a spool placed upon this bar with
the spool upon the wheel-shaft, by means of a string loop.
If this string is not too loose, nor yet too tight, it will turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the top spool as soon as the water sets the wheel and the
bottom spool in motion. The <a href="#circusbar">illustration on page 196</a> shows
how a number of funny animals and men can be made to
do circus tricks on the bar, to the great delight of the
spectators.</p>

<p>To make these figures so that they will move with comical,
but natural, movements, place a piece of transparent
paper over the diagrams and trace the outlines, then blacken
another piece of paper, upon one side, with a soft pencil;
next place a piece of clean card-board under these figures,
over the card-board spread the paper, with the blackened
side next to the card-board, and over this put the tracing
paper, and then, holding it so that it will not slip, follow the
lines of the clown, ape, and donkey, with the point of a
hard pencil. When the card-board is removed the bodies
of the clown, ape, and donkey will appear traced upon the
white surface.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the same manner make tracings of the legs and arms
of the puppets, and with your scissors cut these figures out.
Using the legs and arms cut from the card-board as patterns,
trace around each of them upon another piece of card-board
with a pencil, and cut these duplicates out. You will now
have two each of Figs. 147, 148, 151, 152, 155 and 156.</p>

<p>With the point of your hard pencil, or a darning-needle,
punch holes in all these parts, at the points marked by black
dots.</p>

<p>Next take a small piece of string and make</p>


<h3>A Neat, Round Knot</h3>

<p>in one end of it, and thread the other end through the
clown’s arm, at the dot in his shoulder; then thread the
string through the dot in the clown’s body, near his collar
(Fig. 146). Now thread through the hole in the shoulder
of the duplicate arm. When this much is done, place the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
clown upon a table, with the knot underneath, and drawing
the string up, while holding the clown’s body down with
your other hand, bring the knot snugly against the lower
arm and tie another knot tightly against the upper arm.
This last knot can be made by making a large loop, and then
holding the string in place with one finger until the knot is
slid down against the pasteboard arm and drawn tightly in
place; a second and third knot, tied over this, will make it
large enough for the purpose, and the arms will be found to
move freely, up or down (<a href="#arms">See Fig. 289, Chapter XXIV.</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Attach the legs in the same manner; if you will now thrust
a small stick through both the clown’s fists you can make him
take all the positions of a trained circus-man, by twirling
the horizontal stick between your fingers.</p>

<p>When the water-wheel sets the bar twirling, the donkey,
ape, and clown go through their “stunts,” in a most laughable
manner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">GOOD GAMES WITH TOOTHPICKS AND
MATCHES.</span></h2>


<p>The genuine American lad needs no costly toys with
which to amuse himself, for he has inherited from a long
line of pioneer ancestors a sturdy self-reliance. When the
inclemency of the weather, or some slight illness, confines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
him to his home, he can pass away the time with toys of
his own construction.</p>

</div>


<h3>A Toy is a Plaything,</h3>

<p>and a plaything is any old
thing which chance throws
in our way, with which to
play.</p>


<h3>Wooden Toothpicks</h3>

<p>offer many opportunities
for amusement. I have
seen grown men, in the
reading-rooms of our great
hotels, amuse themselves
and companions for hours
with only a handful of
wooden toothpicks.</p>

<p>Suppose that mumps
have invaded the household,
and
the younger members of the family
are, consequently, confined indoors,
with their youthful jaws tied up in
bandages. If they have no ingenuity
they will be fretful and annoying
to their parents and themselves,
but if they have inherited true
Yankee grit and invention they will
spend their enforced imprisonment
in a very jolly manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is</p>


<h3>A Simple Toothpick Example,</h3>

<p>Fig. 159. Let us see you take away
five toothpicks and leave three perfect
squares.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_236a.jpg" width="300" height="438" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>&mdash;Toothpick Puzzle.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a simple problem, and one
glance at Fig. 160 shows how it is
done, but you must remember that
the other fellows or girls to whom
you put the question are not supposed
to know the solution, and unless the
puzzle-workers are very bright it will
take some thinking to work out the
problem&mdash;at least it will take enough
thought to be a source of amusement
to all concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_236b.jpg" width="300" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span>&mdash;Solution.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the toothpicks are removed
and the problem solved, ask them to</p>


<h3>Lift Three Safety-Matches with One Toothpick.</h3>

<p>Be sure to use safety-matches, if
they are to be had; if not, use burnt
matches, for there is no fun playing
with toys which are liable
to ignite and cause much
more serious results than a
case of mumps.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="221" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 161-165.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>After all the party have
tried in vain to lift the three
matches with the aid of one
toothpick, you may show
them how the trick is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<h3>Explanation.</h3>

<p>Fig. 161 shows the first match, which has been split at the
tail-end with the blade of a pocket-knife; Fig. 162 shows
another match, which has had the tail-end whittled to a
wedge-shaped edge, and Fig. 163 shows the two matches
joined by forcing the wedge end of one match into the split
end of the other. Fig. 164 shows the third match, placed
across the ends of the other two matches.</p>

<p>If you will now pass the toothpick under the first two
matches and over the last, as illustrated by the diagram,
Fig. 164, it is a simple task to lift the three matches and
show your playmates how a seemingly impossible proposition
becomes a thing of great simplicity when it is solved
(Fig. 165.)</p>


<h3>A Spring-Bed.</h3>

<p>Now take a toothpick, Fig. 166, and place another one
across it, as in Fig. 167; cross these two toothpicks, in their
centre, with a third, as in Fig. 168; then run a fourth under
the ends of the two side toothpicks and over the end of the
middle one, as in Fig. 169.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_238.jpg" width="600" height="246" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166 and 167.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the fifth toothpick is run under the other ends of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the two crossed picks and over the free end of the centre
toothpick, you will have Fig. 170.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_239a.jpg" width="600" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 168 and 169.</p></div>
</div>

<p>What is Fig. 170? Well, it is almost anything you wish:
it is a gate, a section of a fence, or a spring-bed. Fig. 171
shows the spring-bed, and to prove that it is a real spring-bed,
if you will set it on the hearth, where there can be no
danger from fire, you may light one leg of the bed with a
match, then stand back and watch the flame eat its way to
the first joint. When this joint is reached the spring is
freed, and the bed flies to pieces, which proves that it is
really a spring-bed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>


<h3>Artificial Water.</h3>

<p>If you wish something to represent water, take a small
looking-glass and place it flat on the floor or a table. Upon
the surface of your glass lake you can place paper boats, and
build shores by heaping books around the edge. Spanning
the water you may have a beautiful bridge of toothpicks or
safety-matches.</p>


<h3>A Bridge of Matches.</h3>

<p>This bridge requires patience and deft fingers to build,
but both patience and skill are necessary in golf, football,
boating, the school, the counting-house, and in art or music,
so you must not be discouraged if your frail match bridge
falls to pieces just when you think the thing is about finished.
Remember that an occasional failure is more than
half the fun; start over again by placing two matches on the
table and placing a third match across them, as in Fig. 172;
then another match under them, as in Fig. 173. Some
matches are made of such brittle stuff as to be unsuited for
this, and others are too short and thick to bend, but good
slender matches can be used, and wooden toothpicks are
even better.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="600" height="236" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 172 and 173.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 174 shows the next step is to thrust two matches
under the under match and over the match which is on top
and across the first two;
the spring in the matches
will hold this frame together.
More and more
matches may be added, in
the same manner as the first
(Fig. 175), until the arch
is of the required length:
that is, until it is long
enough to reach from shore to shore of the looking-glass
lake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="300" height="205" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 174.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If you will now build</p>


<h3>Two Piers,</h3>

<p>or abutments, of matches, by placing a couple of sticks on
each side of the water for the foundations&mdash;the two sticks to
be parallel with each other&mdash;and two more across the ends
of these, log-cabin fashion, until the piers are about two
inches high, facing each other from opposite sides of the
looking-glass, you may set your arch across, from pier to
pier.</p>


<h3>Two Approaches to the Bridge</h3>

<p>must now be built, in the same manner as the arch, so that
the arch can be reached from the shore (Fig. 176), and you
will then have a pretty little structure, spanning a calm and
dainty sheet of water.</p>

<p>If you are still not satisfied with the results of your
skill, you may</p>


<h3>Add a Roof</h3>

<p>to each of your bridge piers, by erecting sides made on the
pattern of Fig. 170, and either capping them with a paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
roof or log-cabin built pyramids, composed of pieces of
matches of different lengths, growing smaller toward the
top.</p>


<h3>A Paper Flag,</h3>

<p>upon the end of a broom-straw, will add dignity and effect
to your bridge; erect it by thrusting the lower end of the
flag-staff through the roof and pier.</p>

<p>Tiring of bridges and puzzles, you can lay out</p>


<h3>A Pioneer Settlement,</h3>

<p>and with toothpicks and matches build log-cabins, such as
those in which our ancestors lived when this land was covered
with vast forests of trees and populated with painted
Indians and wild beasts. Roof your houses with cards
bent in the shape of a roof, and build your chimneys at
one end of the house.</p>


<h3>The Chimneys</h3>

<p>in all log-cabins are built outside and against one end of the
house, and are usually made of sticks and mud, or stones
and mud; but as the rooms in an ordinary dwelling or flat
furnish neither stones nor clay, you must do as our ancestors
did: use the material at hand; which, in your case, will
probably be spools from your mother’s work-basket. Set
the spools, one on top of another, against the end of your
match-stick house and your work is done.</p>

<p>Not only is your work done, but, if you have followed all
these directions, probably the day is also done, and you are
ready for bed and to dream of living in safety-match houses
near the shores of a looking-glass lake; and as you listen you
will hear the glass waves breaking on the shore, and the
howl of the toothpick timber-wolves as they steal among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the rocky crags, made of spelling-books, arithmetics and
dictionaries; or you may be startled from your sleep by the
crack of a match-gun and the answering boom of a spool-cannon;
but these things will only make your sleep the
more peaceful and refreshing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">FUN WITH SCISSORS AND PASTEBOARD AND PAPER.</span></h2>


<p>In winter there are always some blustering, windy days,
when the raw winds from off the ocean howl through our
streets, making the lives of pedestrians miserable; or days
when slush and sleet cause us to wish that we could stay in
the house until winter was packed away in last year’s
almanac.</p>

<p>During such weather there is no fun to be had outdoors,
and we must look for our amusement inside the four walls
of our homes.</p>

<p>It is not every city boy who has an old-fashioned attic
to romp in during bad weather, nor even a basement
where he can seek to amuse himself building sleds or
other outdoor appliances, for use when the weather will
permit.</p>

<p>Many lads are confined in the narrow rooms of flats, and
must needs fret and worry when the bad weather imprisons
them in their narrow home-quarters.</p>

<p>But if such boys will stop quarrelling among themselves,
and cease for a moment teasing the cat, or in other ways
adding to the worries of their dear mamma, they may, by
following the directions given here, find amusement and
fun&mdash;not only for this particular bad day, but for all the
stormy weather of the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Make the Sleigh.</h3>

<p>Fold a card or a piece of card-board in the middle, and
with a pair of shears cut a curved piece off one end, as in
Fig. 177.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="600" height="373" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 177-181.</span>&mdash;The Card Sleigh.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now take a sharp penknife and cut along the black lines
of Fig. 178. When you spread out the card you will have
Fig. 179, and if you bend up all the flaps and bend down the
runners, giving the latter a pinch where they meet in the
centre, you will have as dainty a little sleigh as old Santa
Claus ever owned (Fig. 180).</p>

<p>The seats to the sleigh are simply made, being two
strips of card-board with the corners bent down (Fig. 181).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Make the Horses.</h3>

<p>The horses are more difficult to make, especially for
boys who do not know how to draw a horse; but if such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
youngsters will read the preceding chapter it will tell them
how to make a tracing, and they may make an exact reproduction
of this horse by reversing the tracing and placing a
clean piece of card-board underneath it, and then, with a
lead-pencil, drawing over all the lines as they are in the
illustration. When the card-board is removed they will
find a faint outline of the horse upon the card-board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="525" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 182.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h3>To Cut Out the Horse,</h3>

<p>commence at A (Fig. 182), and cut down to B; then fold the
card-board carefully along the line of the back of the horse,
BC.</p>

<p>BC will now be the top fold and ED will be down to
the feet of the horse, while AB will stand up above the
back, because AB has not been folded.</p>

<p>The rest is not hard work, for any child can follow the
outline with the scissors,
and the result will be a
paper horse with four legs,
upon which it can stand
(Fig. 183).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="300" height="232" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 183.</span>&mdash;The Paper Horse.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Figs. 184, 185, and 186
can be traced in the same
manner as the horse, and
afterward cut out, leaving a
pointed piece of card-board
hanging down, which we
stick through slits cut in the seats (Fig. 181), and in this
manner make the driver and the passengers sit firmly in the
sleigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="497" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 184-189.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Tongue, or Pole.</h3>

<p>A small, smooth stick will answer for the pole to the
sleigh, and it may be fastened with a piece of thread to the
centre of a wooden toothpick which has been previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
thrust through the front runners of the sleigh, as in Fig.
191. The harness and reins are
simply strings tied to wooden
whiffletrees and run through holes
punched in the horses at the
proper places.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_249a.jpg" width="300" height="315" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 190.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>A broom-straw, pushed through
a hole in the driver’s hand, will
do service for a whip, and you
may now have a grand spiked
team of five horses, if you choose
to make that number, or a simple
two-horse or even one-horse
sleigh, as you may choose to make
it: the number of horses being limited only by the industry
of their creators.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_249b.jpg" width="600" height="185" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 191.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Pasteboard Soldiers.</h3>

<p>For a bold soldier man, make the horse just as you made
the sleigh horse, but a cavalryman needs a saddle, and if
you cut out the protruding front of the saddle first and then
fold it as you did with the horse, you may make a saddle
similar to Fig. 188. The girth and stirrups are put on after
the saddle is cut out, the girth being a band of ribbon run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
through slits in the saddle and fastened around the paper
horse.</p>


<h3>The Stirrups</h3>

<p>are cut out of card-board, and fastened to the saddle with
short strings. The saddle-cloth, Fig. 189, is a piece of
paper, folded as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>Trace the soldier, Fig. 187,
in the manner already described,
then cut him out
and set him upon his saddled
charger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="450" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 192-194.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Make reins of string and
run the string through a hole
punched in the horse’s mouth&mdash;where
the bit should be&mdash;and
through a hole
punched in the soldier’s
hand. Put the
cavalryman’s feet in
the paste-board stirrups
and you have
Fig. 190&mdash;a bold soldier
man, ready for
a parade, or to fight with the English or against them. In
fact, so perfect a soldier and</p>


<h3>Such an Ideal Soldier</h3>

<p>is this pasteboard man, that he will never question your
orders, but fight on any side you choose to put him, and when
he is worn out in the service he will utter no complaint if
he is buried in the waste-paper basket, or even used for the
purpose of kindling the kitchen fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>


<h3>Make an Army.</h3>

<p>If you are successful in making one soldier, with industry
you may make a whole regiment of them, and then stand
them in battle array and shoot
them down with a pea-shooter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/i_251.jpg" width="263" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 195-199.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Your conscience need not
bother you in the least, if you
slay a whole regiment, for the
poor fellows won’t care a cent,
and they will leave no widows
and orphans behind to mourn
for them. In fact, you can
bring them all to life again, the
next time you want a battle, by
simply setting them upright
upon their horses once more.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that
boys tire of soldiers and their
murderous weapons, although
both the soldier and his arms
be but harmless paper.</p>

<p>At such a time the reader
can put away his paper warriors
and proclaim to his playmates
that he is a wizard, and
can</p>


<h3>Walk through the Centre of a Visiting Card.</h3>

<p>He may prove that this is no vain
boast by folding the card, Fig. 192,
across its centre (Fig. 193), and with
scissors cutting slits where the lines are drawn on Fig. 193.</p>

<p>When the card is unfolded it will be found to resemble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Fig. 194, and may be stretched carefully until it can be
passed over the head, down over the body to the feet; then
as the self-proclaimed wizard steps out of the card he may
truthfully say that he has
walked through a visiting
card.</p>

<p>After this he may entertain
his playmates by making
a</p>


<h3>Grandmother’s Reticule</h3>

<p>of a square piece of paper
(Fig. 195), which he folds at
the dotted centre line (Fig.
196), and folds again across its
centre (Fig. 197). The next

corner to corner (Fig. 198).</p>

ruled lines on Fig. 199.</p>

to the form of a paper reticule, Fig. 200.</p>

<p>Speaking of grandmothers reminds us of old times, when
above the open grate fireplace the mantel and panelling
was painted a sombre black.</p>

<p>The boys then used to amuse themselves by folding
pieces of paper in the form of Fig. 198, and then cutting</p>

<p>out with the scissors&mdash;the result being that when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
paper was unfolded the
meaningless “thing” resolved
itself into a beautiful
geometrical pattern,
which showed to great
advantage when stuck
upon the black woodwork
of the mantel.</p>

Star.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Benjamin Franklin,
Benjamin Harrison, and
Thomas Lynch, Jr., were
appointed a committee
by the Continental Congress
to design a national
flag for the baby United
States, and you all know
that in the little old
house, 239 Arch Street,
Philadelphia, Betsey
Ross made the</p>


<h3>First American Flag.</h3>

<p>You have also probably
read the legend so
frequently published,
which tells us that the
stars in the original design
were six-pointed,
and were only changed
because some one
showed how</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>


<h3>To Cut a Five-pointed Star with One Clip of the Scissors,</h3>

<p>by folding Fig. 201 in the form of Fig. 202, and folding the
latter in the form of Fig. 204, again folding in the shape of
Fig. 205, and then making a cross-cut at the dotted line.
When the paper was unfolded it appeared in the form of
Fig. 210, a five-pointed star.</p>


<h3>Another Way to Cut a Five-pointed Star,</h3>

<p>is to fold a circular disk of paper (Fig. 206) across its diameter
(Fig. 207), and fold this in the form of a fan (Fig. 209),
which when pressed down
flat will be Fig. 208. One
cut, where the dotted line is
shown on Fig. 208, will produce
the five-pointed star
(Fig. 210). If, as according
to the legend, it was because
of the simplicity of this
one clip of the scissors that
the five-pointed star was
adopted, the old legend
needs revision, for</p>


<h3>A Six-pointed Star can be made with One Cut,</h3>

<p>with no more trouble than it
takes to make the five-point.</p>

<p>Fold the paper as in Figs. 195, 196, and 197 (see Reticule).
Fold the form (Fig. 197) fan-wise, at the dotted lines on Fig.
211, making the divisions equal (Fig. 212). Press the folds
down until they are flat (Fig. 213), and make the cut at the
place indicated by the dotted line. When the paper is unfolded
you will have the six-pointed star, Fig. 214.</p>

<p>This is the star of the East, which guided the wise men

better symbol than the irregular
five-pointed star. The six-pointed
star stands for Peace on
Earth, Good Will to Men. The

star the “pentacle” of

<p>One of the oldest and most

<p>and if you make one of the proportions
of five squares, each of
the three arms of equal size,
and equal to the square space in
the middle, you may, by</p>


<h3>Two Cuts, make the Cross into a Square.</h3>

<p>This will, at first glance,
look like an impossibility, but if
you find the middle of the top end of the cross (Fig. 215),
and lay a straight-edge from the middle point E, touching
the corner F, and rule the line E F G, then rule a line from
H to F, and cut where the lines are ruled, you will have
four irregular pieces, A, B, C, and D, which you may fit
together in the form of a square (Fig. 216).</p>

<p>This is amusement enough for one rainy day, and for
the next one you may try something more artistic, and consequently
more difficult and interesting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO PREPARE AND GIVE A BOYS’ CHALK-TALK.</span></h2>


<p>A natural taste or talent for art is almost universal.
If any of my readers doubt this statement let them supply
all the youngsters in their neighborhood with colored chalks
and note the result.</p>

<p>My word for it, there will not be a paving-flag, wall
or fence in the ward, which offers an opportunity for a picture,
which will not be profusely decorated with brilliantly
colored, grotesque figures.</p>


<h3>We are all Born Artists.</h3>

<p>The truth is that the ability and desire to draw, come
just as natural to a child as its ability and desire to talk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_256.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 217</span> and <span class="smcap">218</span>.&mdash;The Drawing-board.</p></div>
</div>

<p>That almost all children
learn to talk with more or
less fluency, while few learn
to draw with any approach
to skill, is because talking
is encouraged and systematically
taught from earliest
infancy, while drawing is
discouraged, and has been
ever since the days of old
Sakya-Muni, 400 years before the Christian era. Sakya, the
narrow-minded old heathen, thought it detrimental to progress
in virtue to waste one’s time with pencil or brush.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
And to-day, in the gray light of the dawn of the twentieth
century, boys are often forbidden to draw and few are encouraged
in the practice, so that, in fear of punishment, the
youngsters give vent to their artistic feelings by slyly decorating
the flags, walls, and fences.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 219.</span>&mdash;A Chalk-Talker.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Art will never reach the proper standard until these little
“chalk-talkers” are encouraged, and taught to handle their
chalk with the same skill with which they are taught to
use their tongues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Name Chalk-Talk</h3>

<p>was invented by Frank Beard, D.D., the veteran cartoonist,
lecturer, and college professor, and it is the title of his first
public lecture, but since then it has grown to be a popular
name, so that whenever a speaker illustrates what he has to
say by pictures, drawn before the audience, the entertainment
is called a chalk-talk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="600" height="513" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 220-226.</span>&mdash;The Character of Lines.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Besides the ability to stand before an audience and talk,
it is absolutely necessary to have some little knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
drawing, before one can hope to make a success in this
field.</p>

<p>However, any lad, with ordinary ability, can</p>


<h3>Learn by Practise</h3>

<p>to draw well enough to give an interesting show, suitable
for the school-room, Sunday-school, or for a drawing-room
entertainment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="600" height="293" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 227-234.</span>&mdash;Motion.</p></div>
</div>

<p>For this a good blackboard and a few colored chalks are
all the material necessary. The blackboard is a most excellent
thing upon which to practise, but it is much better
to use large sheets of yellowish-brown paper. This paper
is known as chalk-talk paper, and has “tooth” enough to
retain the chalk, and make every stroke tell.</p>

<p>Figs. 217 and 218 show how to make a</p>


<h3>Drawing-Board,</h3>

<p>upon which to fasten the paper. Fig. 217 shows the front
view. Fig. 218 the rear view. The drawing-board can be
made of any size to suit the artist, but should always be
large enough to give full sweep to the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>


<h3>Size of Board.</h3>

<p>To get these proportions take a piece of charcoal in
your hand and stand at arm’s length from the wall, with
your right side toward it, and without changing your
position, or leaning forward, make a mark as high upon the
wall as you can reach. In the same manner make a mark as
low as you can reach, without stooping. Swing your arm
from left to right, make two marks midway between and
upon each side of the first marks. This will give you the
full extent of your reach. It is well to allow a foot more,
each way, for a margin. This will give the proper proportion
for the drawing-board.</p>

<p>The board must be made of soft, smooth pine boards, so
matched that there will be no cracks to annoy you while
drawing.</p>


<h3>The Height of the Easel</h3>

<p>can be obtained by measuring from the floor to the top
mark on the wall, and allowing a foot more for the margin.</p>

<p>The easel is made by screwing two leg-boards on the
back of the drawing-board (Fig. 217), and then, with a hinge
in the middle of the top edge of the drawing-board, attaching
the third or hind leg (Fig. 218).</p>


<h3>Tack the Paper</h3>

<p>securely, at the top and bottom, to the drawing-board,
spread your colored chalks out on the table, and group the
colors so that they will be handy, and when you want any
color you will waste no time seeking that particular lump
of chalk (Fig. 219).</p>


<h3>Keep a Sharp Knife</h3>

<p>handy, on the table, so that as soon as the audience has
seen one picture you can run the point of the knife along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the bottom of the
paper, just above the
tacks, free the lower
edge of the drawing,
throw it up and
over the top of the
easel, without taking
time to detach
it at the top. You
are then ready to
begin upon a new
drawing.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Figs. 235-239.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Drawings Themselves</h3>

<p>must be simple, but
with practice some
very effective designs
can be made
with a few rapid
strokes, which at a
distance will look
like finished paintings.
You may</p>


<h3>Begin Your Talk</h3>

<p>by drawing a vertical
line AB (Fig.
220). As soon as this
is done you must
<em>step aside, so that all
the audience may see</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
what you have drawn, and while they are looking at the
line tell them that you are going to give them a talk upon
the character of lines, and what the lines represent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i_262.jpg" width="345" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 240-242</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>AB conveys the idea of</p>


<h3>A Stationary Object</h3>

<p>&mdash;a telegraph pole, a tree, a church steeple, etc. If there is
one idea which it does not suggest, that idea is motion.</p>

<p>Draw two lines diagonally down from A to the base line
(Fig. 221), and point out that this represents a pyramid,
which when resting upon its base is the</p>


<h3>Emblem of Stability.</h3>

<p>Upon another sheet of paper draw two AB lines, and
joining them at the top (Fig. 222), show that these lines still
represent a stationary object&mdash;a house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="400" height="417" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 243.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>At this point you may work in any comic story of houses
in a Western tornado, which, under a stress of weather are
not stationary, but seem inclined to change their base and
even to fly, etc. Fig. 243 shows how a man becomes a stationary
object when the line AB divides him in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>


<h3>Motion.</h3>

<p>But when you slant the AB lines they suggest motion
(Figs. 224, 225, and 226).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">
<img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="569" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 244.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Although the pyramid is the emblem of stability, when
resting upon its base&mdash;with the AB line dividing it in the
centre&mdash;if you take the same form and point the apex in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
other direction it immediately suggests motion, as in Figs.
227, 228, and 229.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 563px;">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="563" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 245.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Not only does it suggest motion, but it tells the direction
of the movement suggested. Any child can tell in
which direction the arrow and the ducks are flying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>There is</p>


<h3>Another Meaning</h3>

<p>to this figure. It is a wedge, and means cleaving&mdash;entering
into&mdash;(Figs. 230, 231, 232, and 233). But when one views it
from the opposite direction the meaning is just the opposite
to a wedge. It now means reception (Fig. 234). The
mouse is entering and the alligator is receiving.</p>


<h3>Draw All Your Figures as Large as the Paper Will Permit</h3>

<p>you to make them; otherwise the audience, or some persons
in the back part of the audience, will miss part of your talk,
and that will spoil their enjoyment and diminish your applause.</p>

<p>Upon a new sheet of paper draw a horizontal line (Fig.
235), and explain that</p>


<h3>This Line Means Repose.</h3>

<p>It is the position a person assumes in sleep; it is the surface
of the ocean during a calm (Fig. 236).</p>

<p>Here we again have the upright line AB (of Fig. 220), in
the mast of the becalmed and immovable ship of Fig. 236.
When a squall comes up not only does AB change to a diagonal
line (Fig. 237), but the horizontal line, indicating repose,
is broken into a series of irregular points, showing
noise, movement, and commotion. Figs. 238 and 239 show
the same effect of lines.</p>


<h3>Something Which Needs Practice,</h3>

<p>is the ape; but when you draw it carefully a few times and
then practise on it, as you would upon a difficult feat in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
skating, or any other sport, you can learn to draw the thing
in less than a minute. The</p>


<h3>Evolution of the Ape</h3>

<p>is its growth from a few simple lines. First draw Fig. 240,
then add a curved line to the top of the first figure and
some wiggles to the bottom (Fig. 241).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<img src="images/i_267.jpg" width="522" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 246-251.</span>&mdash;Evolution of the Face.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A few more strokes of the chalk and we have the comical
short legs, long toes, and big thumbs (Fig. 242). Prolong
the curve which you drew upon top of the legs until
you have an irregular circle (Fig. 243), and on top of the
circle fit Fig. 244, the arms of the ape. Make the knuckles
rest upon the ground, each side of the feet. From Fig. 246
to Fig. 251, inclusive, is the evolution of the face; but</p>


<h3>For Quick Work</h3>

<p>most all of the wrinkles shown in Figs. 248 and 251 may be
left out. Simply draw the nose and eyes upon Fig. 247 and
add the ears, hair, and whiskers (Fig. 250), and it will look
ape-like enough to bring applause. When this is finished
you have the late lamented Mr. Crowley, of Central Park
Zoo (Fig. 252), which will gain sufficient applause to fully
repay you for all the time spent in practising on the evolution
of the ape.</p>

<p>This will be enough for one talk, and if interlarded with
amusing stories and narrations, will not only hold and
amuse your audience, but will teach them some real truths
in the sign language of drawing, and give them the beginner’s
lesson in the meaning of lines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A CHRISTMAS NOVELTY FOR BOYS.</span></h2>


<h3>How to Build and Decorate a Fireplace for Santa Claus.</h3>

<p>To Mr. Clement C. Moore we are indebted for the creation
of that jolly little gnome, the Americanized Santa
Claus, Kris Kringle, or Saint Nicholas. When “The Night
Before Christmas” was written our homes all possessed
ample chimneys and spacious fireplaces, affording a most
convenient entrance for the merry little saint; but now he
is without doubt sorely puzzled by our modern houses, and
experiences great discomfort and difficulty in entering the
hot-air chamber of the furnaces, and squeezing his corpulent
little body and his pack of gifts through the registers.</p>

<p>A deep sense of gratitude for many favors received, induces
me to offer a few suggestions which will help the
friend of my boyhood to come, as of old, through the
chimney.</p>

<p>Fig. 253 shows</p>


<h3>The First Start</h3>

<p>for the framework, which is made of smooth or rough pine
strips, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> inch thick by 2 inches in width. Make the frame
about 5 feet 4 inches high by 4 feet 6 inches wide; the top and
lower pieces 4 feet 5 inches (A, B, and C, D, Fig. 253) long,
thus allowing <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> inch at each end, to fit the ends of the side-pieces
(R and S, Fig. 256). The diagonals, X and Y (Fig.
253), are temporary braces, to keep the frame in shape, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
are nailed at each end in such a manner that the nails may
be easily withdrawn when it is necessary. The illustration
is so clear that there should be no difficulty in following its
lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_272.jpg" width="600" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 253.</span>&mdash;Beginning the Framework.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The frame, A, E, F, B (Fig. 254), is the</p>


<h3>Back of the Chimney,</h3>

<p>and should reach to the ceiling of the room in which the
fireplace is to be built. Set the frame, A, B, C, D (Fig. 253),
against the wall; then take Z (Fig. 254) and raise it up until
it touches the ceiling, and drive a nail at the intersection
of X and Y into Z, and another exactly in the centre of A,
B; drive them far enough to hold Z in an upright position,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
but leave enough of the nail-heads protruding to make it
easy to redraw them and remove the temporary braces, X,
Y, and Z (Fig. 254), when the whole frame will be finished
and ready to use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="600" height="621" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 254.</span>&mdash;The Back of the Chimney.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Take a stick half the length of A, B (E, F, Fig. 254), and
nail the end of Z exactly to the centre of E, F. By pushing
up one end or the other you may put E, F exactly at right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
angles, or “square” with Z. When the stick, E, F, is found
to be square, cut two more sticks, A, E and F, B, each a
trifle longer than the distance from A to E; cut the ends of
these sticks to fit on the top of A, B, and “toe-nail” them
in place, as is shown in the small diagram in the upper right-hand
corner of Fig. 254. Allow the upper ends of A, E, and
F, B to slip under the ends of the stick, E, F, as in the illustration,
and nail them securely in place; then saw off the
protruding ends even with E, F, and the back of your frame
is finished.</p>


<h3>The Front Frame</h3>

<p>(Fig. 255) is of the same width as A, B, Fig. 253, but it is
the width of the strips R and S, Fig. 256 (two inches),
shorter than the back. The side-pieces, G, N, and H, Q
(Fig. 255), are set with their edges facing the front, and the
top-piece, G, H (Fig. 255), is fitted in with its broad surface
facing the front and flush with the tops and front edges of
the side-pieces, G, N, and H, Q; it is held in place by nails
driven through the side-pieces in the ends of G, H.</p>

<p>The piece J, K, is exactly the same length as G, H, and
forms the top of the fireplace, but unlike G, H, the piece
J, K, has its thin edge flush with the front. It is held in
place by nails which are driven through from the outside
of the two uprights, G, N, and H, Q. All these pieces must
be cut and fitted with exactness, or the framework will be
of no use.</p>

<p>Fig. 256 shows how</p>


<h3>The Remaining Pieces,</h3>

<p>LO, MP, NO, and PQ, are placed, and the figure of the
young workman gives an idea of their proportions which
cannot be given in figures, for the reason that the opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
for the fireplace must be made to suit the size of the boy
who is to be Santa Claus.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 255.</span>&mdash;The Front Frame.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To finish the framework is now</p>


<h3>A Simple Task.</h3>

<p>Make two bottom side-bars (C, N, and D, Q, Fig. 256), each
about two and one-half feet long, and nail them in place,
“toe-nailing” at the front. The two top-bars (R and S,
Fig. 256) must extend out a foot in front, as a support for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the mantel-piece. After these are securely nailed in place
the roof-sticks, <b>a</b> and <b>d</b>, may be fitted in place, and notched
to fit over the mantel supports, as shown in Fig. 256. You
now have a strong but light frame, which must be neatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
covered with gray-colored paper muslin, Manila paper, or
building paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="575" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 256.</span>&mdash;The Finished Frame.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Covering</h3>

<p>must be stretched, and securely tacked to the framework,
so that no wrinkles shall betray its frail nature.</p>

<p>Some black paper muslin is now needed</p>


<h3>To Line the Inside of the Fireplace.</h3>

<p>Tack the ends of two pieces of the black stuff on the
uprights, LO, and MP, and extend one piece back to B, D,
and the other to A, C, and tack them to the back frame;
also stretch a piece of black muslin from A, C, to B, D.
This will make the interior of the fireplace dark and mysterious.</p>

<p>Next take a pot of white paint and a small brush, and
rule white horizontal lines all around the fireplace and
chimney; then paint upright lines, as shown in the illustration
(Fig. 257). This will give the effect of stonework with
white plaster between.</p>

<p>Place a smooth board upon the projecting supports, R
and S, for the mantel, and the work will be done. If you
can secure some old-fashioned brass candlesticks and an
antique clock, for your mantel, they will add greatly to the
effect. A pair of andirons, with some charred sticks of wood,
will give a realistic touch which will win applause (Fig. 257).</p>


<h3>Our American St. Nicholas</h3>

<p>is a jovial little fellow, with a very red nose, white hair,
white beard, short pipe, fur-trimmed clothes, and a little
round belly&mdash;which shakes when he laughs, like a bowl full
of jelly. Every youngster also knows that he comes in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
little sleigh, drawn by eight tiny reindeer; but in spite of
this universal knowledge among the children of America
of Santa Claus’ personal characteristics, the long-legged
saint of Europe still fills our illustrated papers, each year
as heretofore, and badly upholstered giants are made to
stand for the saint in all the shop-windows, and frighten
the children out of their seven senses. It is a fact that
many of the little ones take these big ungainly giants for
the ones which Jack the Giant-killer is supposed to have
slain.</p>

<p>All American children love their little American Christmas

<p>Any boy who has a box of tools, and is at all clever
at carpentry, may make a framework similar to the one
shown in the preceding illustrations, but when it comes to
preparing the</p>


<h3>Costume for Jolly Old Santa Claus</h3>

<p>he will more than likely find it convenient to call for
some assistance from his sisters, though, of course, he
will enjoy the whole thing better if he can make it a real
surprise.</p>

<p>But it is not very difficult for the boys to make a good
representation of St. Nick themselves.</p>


<h3>The Coat.</h3>

<p>When making his costume secure a dark-colored sack
coat which is much too large for the proposed Santa Claus,
and turn back the sleeves at the cuffs until they are the
proper length for Santa Claus’s arms. Stitch the cuffs
lightly to the sleeves, to keep them in place. Turn up the
bottom of the coat all around, making it the proper length
for the little man, and stitch the skirt in place; then, to represent
fur, use white cotton-batting and cover the turned-back
cuffs and skirt with this material, so as to conceal the
alterations. Upon the white trimmings sew little tags of
black cotton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<h3>Use a Fur Cap,</h3>

<p>if you have one; if not, take any sort of a dark cloth one,
and sew a piece of white cotton around the edge. Cover
the legs, below the knees, with heavy woollen stockings and
use big overshoes for the feet.</p>


<h3>How to Put on the Clothes.</h3>

<p>When the boy who is to represent the jolly old saint is
ready to dress, let him put on the knickerbockers first and
stuff the bottom end of a pillow in the front of the breeches;
then put on the coat, and button and belt the pillow inside.
This will give him a jolly big paunch; next put on the stockings
and the overshoes. Then let some one gum a pair of
big white cotton eyebrows to his forehead, using common
mucilage for the purpose; also a long white cotton mustache
and beard. Press these appendages to the face until the
mucilage is dry. The finishing touch is made by painting
the nose a bright red, and then the brave old saint will be
ready to hide in the spacious chimney, to descend and
greet the company when he receives the signal that the
proper time has come for his appearance.</p>

<p>If the false chimney and fireplace are set up against an
open door, Santa Claus may enter from the other room, and
when he lets himself down over the black cloth back of the
fireplace it will appear to the audience&mdash;at least, to all the
little folks&mdash;as if he came down the chimney.</p>

<p>In case no doorway is handy a strong board shelf, built
in the false chimney, will serve as a seat and a place of concealment
for the saint until the clock on the mantel strikes
the hour of twelve, which should be the signal for the immediate
appearance of the little man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Clock,</h3>

<p>of course, should be set ahead of time, so that it will strike
at the proper moment, when everything is in readiness, and
the little folks are trembling with impatience.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO MAKE TWO BOYS INTO ONE SANTA CLAUS.</span></h2>


<p>If your time for preparation is limited, and you still wish
to have a live Santa Claus, you may do so by dispensing
with the artificial fireplace
altogether, and
allowing the old saint
to hold a reception in
the doorway between
two rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_282a.jpg" width="200" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 258.</span>&mdash;Legs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The accompanying
illustrations show you
how you can make
another real live Santa
Claus, in your own
home. Many of you
are familiar with the
trick of the so-called
German dwarf, and
this Santa Claus is an
adaptation of that trick
for a Christmas entertainment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_282b.jpg" width="175" height="462" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 259.</span>&mdash;Legs with
Coat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first picture
(Fig. 258) shows</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>


<h3>How the Old Saint’s Legs are Made</h3>

<p>by pulling a pair of golf stockings over the hands and arms,
and then slipping the hands into the slippers.</p>

<p>It is necessary to choose a short coat, for otherwise the
tails would hide the feet. With any old fur, or substitute
which will look like fur, trim the
coat, making it appear as if it buttoned
up in the middle of the
back.</p>

<p>Some one then puts the coat,
“wrong-side fore,” on to the boy
who acts as legs (Fig. 259).</p>


<h3>The Wig and Beard</h3>

<p>are now put on Mr. Legs, and his
nose is then painted a bright red,
after which a peaked cap, made of
some bright material and trimmed
with something to represent fur,
is placed upon his head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_283.jpg" width="250" height="455" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 260.</span>&mdash;The Little Saint.
Side-View.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Mr. Legs” is now ready for
“Mr. Arms,” and the illustration
(Fig. 260) shows Mr. Arms after
he has thrust his hands and arms
through the sleeves of the fur-trimmed
coat.</p>


<h3>The Curtains</h3>

<p>are securely pinned behind Legs’ head in front of Arms’
face, and brought down around the fur-trimmed coat, outside
of Legs’ real legs, and pinned under his arms, which
are doing the part of the saint’s legs, thus concealing all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
but the little saint. The last illustration (Fig. 261) displays
the jolly little saint distributing candy and small presents
to the young people.</p>

<p>The more care you take in arranging your show, the
greater will be the success of the entertainment. The eight
little reindeer are not necessary, even if they were obtainable,
for the old saint may
be supposed to have unhitched
his steeds for the
time and stabled them on
the roof; but</p>


<h3>The Sleigh</h3>

<p>can be improvised from
any ordinary coasting-sled.
Select one which
looks something like a
sleigh.</p>

<p>When fat little Santa
Claus comes down the
chimney, we all know
that he carries his</p>


<h3>Good Things in a Bag,</h3>

<p>so if you secure a bag,
and stuff it full of any
sort of material, it will
make a most appropriate load for the sleigh. A fur rug
will add to the effect, but is not necessary.</p>

<div id="littlesanta" class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i_284.jpg" width="425" height="611" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 261.</span>&mdash;The Little Saint. Front View.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the sleigh and bag do not reach high enough for the
saint to stand on, a stage must be made of some old box,
covered by a white sheet or white canton-flannel cloth, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
represent snow, and on this stage set the sleigh and bag, as
shown in the <a href="#littlesanta">illustration on page 250</a>.</p>

<p>A second bag should be procured, in which all the presents
have been placed; each present should be carefully
covered with enough paper to protect it from injury, as
well as to conceal and make a mystery of the contents of
the package.</p>


<h3>When All is Ready</h3>

<p>have a curtain or screen set up before Santa Claus, turn
down the lights and invite the company into the room, then
make them keep very quiet and listen for Santa Claus.</p>

<p>In an adjoining room some one in the secret has a set of
sleigh-bells, which are jingled very softly at first, gradually
growing louder and louder, as if the sleigh was approaching
nearer; when they stop a stamping of feet is heard.</p>

<p>This last is</p>


<h3>The Signal for Legs,</h3>

<p>who cries out, in his deepest bass, “A pretty Christmas
this! Company here, and all hiding behind a screen. What,
ho! are ye afraid of Santa Claus?” At that the master of
ceremonies removes the screen, and there before the eyes
of the delighted company is a real live Santa Claus, who
can move his legs and arms, and talk!</p>

<p>The entertainment is</p>


<h3>Concluded</h3>

<p>by the old saint fishing the presents out of the bag and
handing them to the master of ceremonies, who calls out
the name found on each bundle and presents it to the
claimant.</p>

<p>During the time devoted to the distribution of presents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Santa Claus can make plenty of fun, for as the arms belong
to one boy and the legs and head to another, the legs and
head never know exactly what the arms are about to do
next, and if the arms take a handkerchief out of a pocket to
wipe the face, there is always a mirth-provoking incident,
and the face does not look happy until the handkerchief is
put away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A CIRCUS IN THE ATTIC.</span></h2>


<h3>How to Make the Horses and Other Animals, and How to Make the Costumes.</h3>

<p>In all mimic circus performances the boys of a generation
ago were sadly handicapped by the want of horses;
sometimes goats and dogs were pressed into service, but
these animals flatly refused to allow the youthful circus
riders to mount their backs, and as substitutes for horses
proved good for nothing but the creation of confusion.</p>

<p>When</p>


<h3>The Goat</h3>

<p>was supposed to canter around the ring, he had a way of
standing on his hind legs and coming down head-first,
which utterly demoralized our ring-master, and even caused
the clown to do many “stunts” not down on the programme.
The dog would wag his tail and bark in a manner very unlike
a true circus horse.</p>

<p>It sometimes happened that one of the performers was
the proud owner of a real live pony. Alas! even a pony
had its objectionable features, for however willing the animal
might be to climb the stairs, for reasons unaccountable
to us, our parents put forth such strong objections that the
pony had to be left out of the show.</p>


<h3>Since the Writer’s Circus Days</h3>

<p>the safety bicycle has made its appearance, and as a consequence
every boys’ show may now be supplied with circus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
horses which the boys can ride, and which will neither butt
nor bark; furthermore, parents will not object to the presence
in the attic of rubber-shod hoofs, which make no noise.</p>


<h3>The “Arab Steed”</h3>

<p>is made by fastening a simple framework of sticks and
hoops to an ordinary wheel. The head may be made of the
canvas cover of a ham, stuffed with excelsior, or a piece of
cloth sewed into the form of a ham-cover, and stuffed lightly
with excelsior.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_288.jpg" width="600" height="384" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 262</span> and <span class="smcap">263</span>.&mdash;Showing Skeleton of Horse.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>A Feather-Duster May Do Service as a Tail.</h3>

<p>Fig. 262 shows the wheel, with the backbone rod, A B,
lashed to the top tube of the frame and the feather-duster
made fast to the tail-end of the rod, A B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Neck-Bones</h3>

<p>are the two rods, C D and E D. The rod C D is bound to
the saddle-post, below the point where the head and top
tubes join under the handle-bar. The lower neck-bone, E
D, is lashed to the top of the bracket-tube at E, just out of
reach of the pedals, and to the upper neck-bone, at D.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_289.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 264.</span>&mdash;Ready for the Cover.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Ribs</h3>

<p>are made from ordinary wooden barrel-hoops. Fig. 263
shows front-view of wheel, with one hoop in place. The first
hoop is tied on the neck-bone, in front of the handle-bars,
and the next two hoops are lashed to the backbone, behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the saddle-bar, as shown in Fig. 264. The head is tied to
the end of the neck-bones, at D, and eyes, mouth, and nostrils,
painted on the ham-cover head.</p>


<h3>The Frame</h3>

<p>now only needs to be covered with a cloth of some kind, to
make a most speedy “Arab steed.” The covering for the
horse may be gaudily colored
paper muslin, with the addition,
perhaps, of some quaint
figures cut out of gold, red,
or black paper, and pasted in
place, as shown by the illustration.
Two sheets may be
made to do duty as a horse-cover;
or two old shawls,
properly draped and fastened
to the skeleton or framework,
will answer the purpose;
but it is, on the whole,
best to buy the paper muslin,
as this may be cut and sewed
at pleasure. Cut it so as to
cover both head and neck,
leaving eye-holes and holes
for mouth and nose, also a
large opening where the fearless
circus rider is to sit and work the pedals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 265-267.</span>&mdash;The Inside of the Bird.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Reins</h3>

<p>may be made of ribbons and run from the mouth to the
handle-bars. The horse’s blanket should be stitched to the
first hoop on the neck, and not allowed to hang loose, as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
would be certain to interfere with the free movement of the
front wheel and bring the Arab steed into trouble not down
on the programme, causing him to act more like a bucking
Western bronco than a gentle, well-trained circus horse.</p>


<h3>The Moa is the Giant Bird from New Zealand,</h3>

<p>and is simply made, as a glance at Figs. 265, 266, and 267
will prove. Fig. 265 shows a cone made of card-board, the
edges of which are stitched or glued together, and the whole
covered with white or yellow paper. Fig. 266 is the neck-bone,
a stick with a pad of rags or paper tied over the upper
end. A sheet, or other plain-colored cloth, is stitched to the
cone in such a manner that the drapery will fall down and
hide all but the feet and legs of the boy holding the neck-bone
(Fig. 267). Some black paint or ink can be used to
mark the eyes and mouth on the paper cone, and the only
living example of the moa, the giant bird of New Zealand, is
ready to be led around the ring before the eyes of the awestruck
spectators. For an extra charge the strange bird
will even allow one of the smaller spectators to ride its back
(the boy’s shoulders) around the ring.</p>


<h3>The Manicora</h3>

<p>is an imaginary beast, once thought to inhabit America.
From all I can learn from old prints it was supposed
to be a sort of lion, with a human face. If any of your
circus company own a French poodle, or any sort of long-haired
dog which can be shaved like a lion, he can make a
beautiful manicora by sewing a skirt, long enough to reach
below the dog’s collar, on to a cheap false-face. With a little
patient work the dog may be taught to walk around the
ring with a false-face on. The mask is held in place by
tucking the cloth under the dog’s collar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>By using</p>


<h3>A Little Ingenuity,</h3>

<p>any number of fierce and strange animals can be made, to
astonish and please the audience; every boy knows how to
make an elephant of two boys covered with a gray shawl,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and a giraffe can be made by adding another boy to the moa,
so as to give it four legs; but the limited space at my disposal
forbids my introducing more diagrams.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 268-274.</span>&mdash;Ring-master and His Costume.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Dignified and Self-sufficient Ring-master</h3>

<p>must dress in black, and have high boots, or at least what
appear to be high boots. This appearance can be made
with a few cents’ worth of black paper muslin, sewed over
two cylinders (Fig. 272) of pasteboard. These, when finished,
will look like top-boots (Figs. 273 and 274.)</p>


<h3>Tight-fitting Knee-breeches,</h3>

<p>black or some dark color, and a dark coat, will be all that is
required for lower parts; but the head must be adorned
with a high hat, and if an old silk hat of the proper size cannot
be procured, you can make one by fitting a muslin-covered
pasteboard top on to an ordinary black derby hat (see
Figs. 268, 269, 270, 271, and 274.) A standing collar and a
flashy or plain white necktie will finish the costume. Of
course the ring-master must have a long whip, with which
he makes believe to whip the clown when the latter tries
one of his jokes at the ring-master’s expense.</p>


<h3>A Jersey or a Tight-fitting Undershirt</h3>

<p>will do duty for the circus rider’s upper garment, and if he
can induce some one to make him a pair of light-colored
trunks he can appear in his underclothes, and no one will
know but that he has on the regular showman’s tights.</p>


<h3>A Girl’s Old Turban Hat,</h3>

<p>set jauntily on his head, will add to the effect, especially if
this head-gear be decorated with a long, curling feather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 553px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 275-278.</span>&mdash;The Clown.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the reader is not fortunate in the possession of some
accommodating female relative who will help him out by
kindly making the trunks, he may take an old pair of loose-fitting</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<h3>Knickerbockers,</h3>

<p>and cut the legs off, just below the thigh; then cut slits near
the bottom, through which he may run a piece of tape, as
the pucker-string is run in the top of a marble-bag.</p>

<p>To put on these trunks he must turn them</p>


<h3>Wrong Side Out</h3>

<p>and put them on upside down, then fasten the string as high
up on his leg as it will go, after which he can reach down
and turn the breeches up until they come to the proper
place around his waist. It will then be seen that they are
not only right side out, but that the cloth folds over and
conceals the pucker-strings as neatly as if the trunks were
made by a tailor.</p>


<h3>Take an Old Soft Felt Hat</h3>

<p>(Fig. 275) and soak it well in warm or hot water, then put it
over the blunt end of a bedpost, or any similar object, and
firmly but steadily pull down the rim (Fig. 276), until the
crown is given a conical form (Fig. 277). If you pull too
hard you will run the post through the hat; but with a little
care you may shape any old soft felt hat into the typical
head-gear of the clown (Figs. 277, 278).</p>

<p>Your father’s, big brother’s, or uncle’s</p>


<h3>Pajamas,</h3>

<p>will make an excellent suit of clothes for the clown. Hoist
the pantaloons up under your arms and fasten them there;
then put garters around the ankles. Belt in the upper garments
at the waist, and put elastic garters on your wrists.
Persuade your sister, mother, or aunt, to make a ruff for your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
neck, from a piece of stiff white muslin, and you will have as
good a clown’s suit as appears in the real circus, (Fig. 278).
When</p>


<h3>Making-Up</h3>

<p>for the ring, take some common flour and put it in a piece
of mosquito-netting; with this, powder your hair, face, and
neck, until all is as white as the driven snow, then wet a
towel and mark out a big, laughing mouth.</p>

<p>You are now ready to caper into the ring and throw your
peaked hat at the ring-master.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A BOYS’ STAG-PARTY</span></h2>


<p>The only difference between the bald-headed, bearded
boy and his younger brother in knickerbockers is that the
latter is fond of fun and owns up to it, while the former is
fond of fun and conceals the fact behind a solemn countenance
and a severe and dignified frown.</p>

<p>But when the</p>


<h3>Old Boys</h3>

<p>attend a stag-party the solemn faces and frowns are not
there; they leave them with their overcoats in the hall.</p>

<p>When sending</p>


<h3>Invitations to a Boys’ Stag-Party,</h3>

<p>it should be suggested that the guests come in their old
clothes, and not be late for the target-shooting. You must
have some blow-guns and a target ready for them to use
when they arrive.</p>


<h3>Make the Target</h3>

<p>of a large sheet of Manila paper. Outline the rings by placing
the paper on the floor, driving a tack in the centre of
the paper, and then using a piece of string with a loop at
one end and a very short pencil at the other end, place
the loop over the tack and fasten the pencil to the string.
In this way make a number of circles, and number them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
from one to ten or fifteen, according to the number of
guests you have invited to your stag-party.</p>

<p>When the target is finished lay it aside, and busy yourselves
making darts for the blow-guns. Take a number of</p>


<h3>Carpet Tacks</h3>

<p>and some bright-colored worsted; tie the worsted string to
the tack until the latter is covered, all but its point, then
push all the ends of the strings back to the head of the tack
and cut them off evenly, leaving them about a quarter of an
inch long.</p>

<p>When one of these darts is shot through the blow-gun it
will stick into anything it hits, unless the target be of stone
or metal.</p>

<p>When the darts are all made lay them aside, with the
blow-guns and the target, and go to the market and secure a
basketful of an assortment of</p>


<h3>All the Large Vegetables</h3>

<p>you can find&mdash;big turnips, the
largest sweet potatoes, small
squashes, field-beets, and compact
cabbages. Some of the
vegetables in this list may be
out of season, but there will
always be some that are in
season.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_298.jpg" width="300" height="328" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 280 and 281.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cut the top of each turnip,
beet, potato, and squash, leaving
a slanting or beveled edge
to the lid (Fig. 280); then hollow out the vegetable until
you have space enough to hold a fair-sized paper of candy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Put the candy in oiled paper, place it in the hollow vegetable
and fit the lid on the top, where it can be secured
by using wooden toothpicks as tacks (Fig. 281). If this
work has been done with any sort of care, no one, not in
the secret, will suspect that it is not a common vegetable.</p>


<h3>The Cabbage Bonbon Box</h3>

<p>is made in the same manner, only in this case you must
carefully peel off the first covering of leaves from the head
of cabbage and then cut a hole for the bonbons, as in Fig.
282. After the candy is in place the leaves removed
from the cabbage must be carefully replaced, and fastened
on with toothpicks, which are concealed by the surrounding
leaves (Fig. 283).</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 282</span> and <span class="smcap">283</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When you have made one of these novel bonbon boxes
for each guest, you can begin to make</p>


<h3>The Big Pie or Pudding</h3>

<p>which is to grace the centre of the table. Buy a number
of cheap toys, such as little china dolls (both black
and white), whistles, rattles, etc., and to each one you
attach a card with some comic verse or sentence written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
on it; then you roll the toy up in a number of pieces of
soft paper until the bundle assumes a ball-like form. The
outside wrapper of each bundle should be of the brightest-colored
tissue-paper which can be found. After securely
binding the bundles with twine attach a bright piece of tape
or silk ribbon to each, as in Fig. 284.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_300.jpg" width="600" height="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 284.</span>&mdash;Attach a Bright Piece of Ribbon.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When all the</p>


<h3>Knick-knacks and Jokes</h3>

<p>are bundled up, and the ribbons attached, place them in a
large earthen dish or wooden bread-bowl, and arrange them
so that the ribbon to each parcel hangs outside. Then fill
the bowl with bran and pat into a rounded surface, as shown
in Fig. 285.</p>


<h3>The Ribbons Must be Loosely Knotted</h3>

<p>at the sides, to keep them from harm, after which the surface
of the “fake” cake is covered with a layer of wheat
flour, to represent frosting, and the flour is ornamented
with raisins, as in the illustration, while the top is decorated
with a few sprigs of green or the ornaments from the
top of a real cake, and the “fake” cake is then ready to
serve.</p>


<h3>Don’t Disappoint the Boys.</h3>

<p>While both the boys in knickerbockers and the boys
in long-tailed coats like fun, neither the old nor the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
boys enjoy being disappointed. You must, therefore, have
some real pie, cake, and good things to serve, besides the
make-believe cake, so as to keep all the guests good-humored.</p>


<h3>The Shooting.</h3>

<p>When all the lads have assembled and the target is in
place, give one prepared tack and the blow-gun to one boy,
and let him have a shot at the target, and keep account of
the number he comes nearest to with the dart.</p>

<p>When all the boys have had their turn at firing a shot,
and</p>


<h3>The Numbers are All Recorded,</h3>

<p>show them a list, with a penalty opposite each number;
for instance, number one must wear two feathers in his
hair; number two must have his face decorated with black
circles; number three, face decorated with black stripes;
number four, hair powdered white, with flour; number five,
half face black, etc. Then tell them the list was made out
by the Mad March Hare.</p>


<h3>When All the Boys are Properly Decorated,</h3>

<p>with blackened or whitened faces, coats wrong side out, etc.,
let them march to the table in the order of their numbers,
and take the numbered seat which corresponds with the
number they struck on the target. When the boys are
seated the maid should bring in</p>


<h3>Great Trays, Heaped with Raw Garden-Stuff.</h3>

<p>This will cause a shout of surprise and disappointment;
but after some lad has laboriously cut a great turnip in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
half, and discovered the concealed
sweets, the fun will begin
anew.</p>

<p>After this first course of
vegetables</p>


<h3>The Regular Spread May Be Served,</h3>

<p>and when all have finished you
must rise and say that you hope
that your guests have still kept
a little of their appetites for a
piece of March Hare pie. Then
you don a big white apron,
thrust a table-knife in your belt,
so as to look like a cook, and
bring in</p>


<h3>The Great “Fake” Cake</h3>

<p>(Fig. 285). Place the cake in
the centre of the table, with the
ribbons carefully undone and
one end stretched to each plate.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 285.</span>&mdash;Bring in the Cake.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>At a Given Signal</h3>

<p>each guest gives a sharp pull
upon his line, and out pop
all the brightly-colored
parcels, while
the bran and flour
fly, as if an explosion
had occurred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Feast of the Mad March Hare.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The success of this last act depends entirely upon the
host. He must caution each boy not to gather in any of
the slack of his ribbon, but only take a firm hold of the end
and wait until the word is given to pull.</p>

<p>After the excitement and fun of demolishing the “fake”
cake, then comes the fun of unrolling the bundles and reading
the jokes attached to each trinket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="titlefont">A WILD WEST SHOW IN THE HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p>There are many boys to-day who have never seen an
Indian, and while it is impossible for us all to view the real
Wild West, it is not difficult for us to get up a little Wild
West show of our own, at home.</p>


<h3>Patterns Are Here Given,</h3>

<p>which any intelligent boy can copy. The fields of the patterns
given are divided into small squares, and the dividing
lines are numbered and lettered along two sides of the
pattern.</p>

<p>It is not hard to understand that, since every square,
be it big or little, is exactly the same shape, by making the
same number of larger squares you will have an enlarged
field, similar to the one shown.</p>


<h3>How to Reproduce the Patterns.</h3>

<p>Place a clean piece of card-board on the table, and, with
the aid of a straight-edged piece of board, rule a line close
to the edge of the card-board and parallel to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 553px;">
<img src="images/i_307.jpg" width="553" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 286.</span>&mdash;The Parts of Mounted Cowboy and Indian.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By means of a two-foot measure, or tape-line, mark off
with your pencil a point at each half-inch, to correspond
with the numbered lines on the field (Fig. 286). Number
the lines from one to thirty-three, as they are numbered in
Fig. 286. Replace the straight-edged board along the line,
take a large flat book (your geography will do), see that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
edge of the board is exactly parallel to the pencil line, and
just far enough back of it to show the pencil dots, hold the
board firmly in place, and slide the book along the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the board, until the edge of the book is exactly at the first
pencil dot.</p>


<h3>Rule the First Line</h3>

<p>along the edge of the book, then move the book to the next
dot and rule the line No. 1, then No. 2, and so on, until No.
33 is ruled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_308.jpg" width="600" height="563" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 287.</span>&mdash;Mounted Indian.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Again Take Your Two-foot</h3>

<p>rule or tape measure, and mark off by pencil dots the points
for the lines at A, B, C, D, etc.; do the same on the line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
No. 33, and with your board ruler connect with lines the
two sets of dots, and you will have a field of squares exactly
similar to the one in Fig. 286, only much larger.</p>


<h3>Next Trace Out the Cowboy,</h3>

<p>horse, and Indian, by drawing a line upon your enlarged
field from point to point, as it is seen to cross the squares in
the small pattern. In the pattern the Indian has but one
leg and one arm, and the horse but one fore leg and one
hind leg, but after these are cut out it is a simple matter to
trace around them on card-board with a pencil, and thus
supply all of the missing limbs.</p>


<h3>After the Puppets Are Cut</h3>

<p>out, punch holes with a darning-needle at the points marked
A; these are the joints, and the spots where the parts are
joined by a piece of string.</p>


<h3>Make a Round Knot</h3>

<p>in the end of a piece of string, so large that it will not pull
through the needle-holes. Take the hind leg of the horse
and thread the string through A, then through A upon the
horse’s hip, then through the hole in the other hind leg.
Pull the string taut and, placing the puppet flat, tie a knot
close to the leg (Fig. 289).</p>


<h3>How it is Done.</h3>

<p>To do this make a loose knot first, and with the forefinger
of the left hand press the loop against the puppet while you
slowly pull the free end taut (see Fig. 289). Tie it three or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
four times, until the knot is too large to pull through the
needle-hole; then cut off the end of the string.</p>

<p>Join all the limbs in the same manner, and the two parts
of the horse’s body. The result will be a horse with a body
which will bend and legs which will move in a most natural
manner.</p>


<h3>As the Audience</h3>

<p>can see only the shadows, the joints will not be perceptible,
and the horse and rider can be made to take the most natural
poses. The <a href="#silhouettes">silhouettes on the next page</a> were traced from
a puppet made from this pattern.</p>

<div id="arms" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_310.jpg" width="600" height="394" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 288</span> and <span class="smcap">289</span>.&mdash;The Wild Buffalo.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>For a Bridle</h3>

<p>fasten a loop of string in the bit and the rider’s hand. To
make the horse buck, fasten a piece of fine thread to his tail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and another piece to his head; then, by alternately pulling
taut and allowing the thread to slacken, the horse will be
found to jump, pitch, and buck, in a life-like and most approved
Wild West manner. Fig. 290 (the page illustration)
shows a photograph made from the puppet here described,
and Figs. 291, 292, 293, and 294 are positions assumed by that
puppet, and traced directly from the paper horse and rider.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 290.&mdash;A Bronco Buster.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Indian Horseman</h3>

<p>(Fig. 287) shows how the body is joined; the dotted line indicates
where the portion of the fore part of the body laps
under the hind part. In Fig. 287 the legs are not jointed as
in Fig. 286. In drawing your pattern for this puppet make
two fields of squares: one for the fore part and one for the
hind part of the Indian and horse; and in Fig. 288 make
three fields of squares, one for the hind legs, one for the
body and one for the head. Both of the last diagrams are
drawn on one field to save space; but you can easily understand
how to reproduce them. For instance, in Fig. 287
make a field of squares from 0 to 18 for the fore part;
make another field of squares from 12 to 34 for the hind
quarters.</p>

</div>

<p>Make five or six duplicates of the Indian horseman;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
make as many duplicates of the dancing Indians as may be
required for your war-dance; do the same with</p>


<h3>The Buffalo,</h3>

<p>until you have a herd of them. Paste the flat end of a stick
to the buffalo’s leg and fasten a thread to the neck and hind
legs, as shown by Fig. 288. With the stick you move the
bison along, and with the string you make him throw up his
head and hind legs in a most amusing and comical manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_314.jpg" width="600" height="498" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 295.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h3>A Piece of White Muslin,</h3>

<p>stretched taut, with no wrinkles, will make your stage, and
a light behind it will throw the shadows of your puppets on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the cloth. The stage should be surrounded with heavy curtains,
to prevent the operators from being seen, and the light
behind the stage from illuminating the room in front. A
bicycle lamp or an ordinary candle will answer for the light.
A sheet of smooth Manila paper makes a better stage than
the white cloth; it may be tacked upon a frame, or the bottom
edge be tacked to a kitchen table and the top to a rod,
suspended from the ceiling. The table should be on the
audience side of the screen, so that the showmen may have
room to move their puppet-sticks along the inside edge of
the table, and keep the puppets close to the screen of paper.
By changing the cowboy’s hat to a soldier’s cap or helmet,
and putting a sword or gun in his hand, you can make as
many cavalrymen from this pattern as you desire to have
in the show.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<span class="titlefont">HOW TO HAVE A PANORAMA SHOW.</span></h2>


<p>After you have had a rollicking-circus in the attic, and
a roaring Wild West show in the basement, you can explain
to your parents that a panorama is a show of a “highly
moral” and most genteel character, and you may persuade
them to allow you to have a panorama party in the dining-room.</p>


<h3>A Good Panorama</h3>

<p>is always a thing worth looking at, yet I promise you that
there is more real enjoyment in making a panorama and
exhibiting it, than there is in looking at twenty professional
exhibitions.</p>


<h3>The Subject</h3>

<p>of the pictures must be your first thought. In their selection
you have the widest possible range of choice, from the
“Yankee in King Arthur’s Court” to Roosevelt with the
Rough Riders in Cuba, or from “The Pilgrim’s Progress”
to “Jack the Giant-killer,” or “Mother Goose.”</p>

<p>To those who have acquired the happy art of expressing
their ideas with pencil and brush, the painting of an original
panorama need not be explained; but the great majority of
boys are unable to make pictures, either with pencil or with
brush, and for them there remains still another method,
which for beginners is equally, if not more effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>


<h3>With Paste-pot and Shears,</h3>

<p>any boy, of ordinary ability, may make pictures galore by
cutting the figures and even the backgrounds from illustrated
papers, grouping and arranging them to suit himself,
and pasting them neatly upon a long, strong strip or ribbon
of paper, suited to winding and unrolling by means of two
cylinders or rollers, as shown in Fig. 296.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="600" height="531" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 296.</span>&mdash;The Panorama.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>Select Your Topic</h3>

<p>first, then write out the number of illustrations you wish to
make to tell the story; then hunt for a background here, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
foreground there, and houses and people wherever they
may be found. Paste the background on your strip of
paper first, then the foreground, and next add the necessary
number of people, vehicles, animals, and other objects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_318.jpg" width="600" height="545" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 297.</span></p></div>
</div>


<h3>Colored Figures,</h3>

<p>upon a white background, will be found to be most effective.
Giants may be made by taking large-sized prints of men,
clipping off their heads and replacing the latter with heads
of smaller men. Dwarfs may be made by using the small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
prints of men, and substituting big heads for the ones originally
belonging to the figures.</p>

<p>Fig. 296 shows</p>


<h3>The Works of the Panorama,</h3>

<p>naked and unadorned. But the machinery should be concealed,
and for this purpose make a box, similar to the one
shown in Fig. 297, which is called the stage. It is simply a
narrow box, as shown in Fig. 298, with drapery arranged
from the outer edges to a small
frame at the rear. Fig. 297 is the
front of the finished stage; Fig.
298 is the rear of same, denuded of
its drapery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_319.jpg" width="250" height="205" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 298.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Hiding in the cellar, basement,
attic, or woodshed, of almost every
house, are a lot of packing-cases,
but if from any cause these boxes
should be absent from their accustomed
places, you must go to your grocer for the material
for your stage.</p>


<h3>Build a Narrow Box,</h3>

<p>of about the proportions of Fig. 298, and make a frame of
four sticks for the back of the box; notch the cross-sticks
(Fig. 299) so that they will fit flush, or even, with the inside
surface of the two long pieces (Fig. 300).</p>


<h3>Cut Some Dark Red Canton Flannel</h3>

<p>into four pieces, to fit the four sides of your stage frame;
plait the ends, and tack each plait as the drapery is tacked
to the frame, as shown in Fig. 300.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>After all four pieces of drapery are plaited and tacked
fast, nail the frame to the back of the stage, as it is shown in
Fig. 298; then, one piece at a
time, spread the edges of the
cloth over the front edges of
the box of the stage and tack
them there, as in Fig. 297.
This will give you a dark-colored
stage frame with a small
opening at the back end for
the panorama to slide by, as
the crank of the roller is
turned by the showman behind
the curtain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="300" height="493" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 299</span> and <span class="smcap">300</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Curtains must be arranged
to hang down on each side of
the stage and be pinned together
above and below it.</p>


<h3>The Stage</h3>

<p>should rest upon a table, and
be lighted by a row of small
Christmas-tree candles, or common candles cut off and made
short.</p>

<p>Whatever lights are used, care should be taken to place
them so that there will be no danger from fire.</p>

<p>Of course it is not absolutely necessary to use candles for</p>


<h3>Footlights.</h3>

<p>Any sort of light which will illuminate the panorama
without obstructing the view of the audience, will answer the
purpose; but it is absolutely necessary to have no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
lights burning in the room while the panorama is being exhibited.
All the light must be centred upon the pictures.</p>

<p>Fig. 301 shows</p>


<h3>How the Panorama Box</h3>

<p>is built. There are two holes bored through the top board
and through the upper bottom board, but not through the
lower bottom board. A glance at the diagram will show you
that there are two bottom boards, fitting closely together.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_321.jpg" width="300" height="209" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 301.</span>&mdash;The Panorama Box.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Before putting the panorama
box together bore holes
in the top board, at equal
distances from the ends, and
as near the front edge as you
can conveniently bore them
without danger of splitting
the board. These holes are
for the rollers, and should be
of sufficient size to allow the
rollers to revolve with little friction. In case you have no bit
or auger which will make large holes, Fig. 302 shows how
the difficulty may be overcome with a small bit, gimlet, or
red-hot poker, by boring a number of small holes in a circle
and then breaking out the centre-piece of wood; smoothing
the inside with a sharp knife. In order that the holes
in the bottom board shall be directly under those in the
top, nail the bottom board to the top board with three wire
nails, driving them in only just far enough to hold the
boards together while the holes are being bored, as shown
in Fig. 303. Since the</p>


<h3>Top Board</h3>

<p>fits over the side-pieces, and the bottom boards fit between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the side-pieces, it is evident that the bottom boards are
shorter than the top board by just the width of the two
side-pieces. Be careful to allow for this width at the ends,
when you nail the boards together, as shown in Fig. 303.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_322.jpg" width="350" height="215" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 302 and 303.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After the holes are
bored through the two
boards, nail the top board
and bottom boards in
place, as shown in Fig.
301.</p>

<p>You must, of course,
put the bottom board
with the holes in it, on top
of the bottom board without the holes. This will give two
sockets, in which to rest and turn the ends of the rollers.</p>


<h3>Make the Rollers of Broomsticks,</h3>

<p>if you can secure nothing better, but if you can find some
old window-shade rollers they will probably be an improvement
on the broomsticks, as they have metal sockets in
which they will turn with much less friction than in the
wooden ones described above.</p>

<p>The rollers should both be of sufficient length to allow
a convenient amount of stick to protrude from the top of
the box, as is shown in Fig. 296.</p>


<h3>A Crank or Windlass</h3>

<p>handle, of some kind, is necessary to turn the rollers, and
Figs. 304 to 311 show how such handles may be made.</p>

<p>If you wish a comic panorama you have at your disposal
a vast amount of material. The gorgeously-colored comic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
prints of to-day lend themselves readily to the process of
picture-making with paste-pot and shears, and all sorts of
funny combinations can be produced, which will delight the
audience, and, best of all, furnish indoor amusement and
work for the reader when the weather is so boisterous, wet,
and sloppy that there is no chance of fun out-of-doors, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
there are many such days, between January and May, each
year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_323.jpg" width="600" height="596" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 304-311.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When all is done, paint some</p>


<h3>Big Show-Bills,</h3>

<p>to hang in the hallway, to be read and admired by the
guests. Set the frame stage upon a small table, with the
panorama box close against it; over the frame a small piece
of dark cloth may be thrown, to be removed when the show
begins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="300" height="240" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 312.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The candles may be set upon a narrow strip of board, in
front of the stage, and if you drive nails in groups of three,
along the board, you will discover that the nails will hold
the candles secure, as shown
in the arrangement of the
footlights in Fig. 312.</p>

<p>In front of each candle
set</p>


<h3>A Square Piece of Tin</h3>

<p>bent to a curve, and with
the concave side next to the
candle, to act as a reflector,
and the convex side next to the audience. The outsides
should be painted dark red, to match the frame and conceal
the light.</p>

<p>At the appointed time</p>


<h3>Turn Out All the Lights</h3>

<p>in the room, light the footlights, and remove the cloth from
the box, displaying the first scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>One boy should stand in front, as lecturer, and explain
the different pictures, and another boy stand behind the
curtain, winding up the paper as directed by the lecturer.
The audience will have a good time, in proportion to the
fun the lecturer puts in his talk, and all will enjoy the show
to</p>

<p class="center boldfont">Profusely Illustrated. Square 8vo, $2.00</p>

<p>No writer for boys has a larger or more enthusiastic following
than Mr. Dan. Beard, and the announcement of a new book by him
should be welcome news to his many young friends. “The Jack of
All Trades” has been written in response to a direct demand from
boys from all over the United States and many parts of the British
Provinces. From their letters the author discovered that there was
a great demand for more material along the lines of the “American
Boy’s Handy Book” and “The Outdoor Handy Book.” “The Jack
of All Trades” presents a vast number of new ideas which any boy
can put into execution, and which will be a source of endless delight.</p>

<p>“This book is praiseworthy from end to end, and will find favor even
with those who have long since passed to man’s estate.”&mdash;<cite>The
Nation.</cite></p>

<p>“It is one of the completest things of the kind ever written, and
with it one can hardly conceive how a boy could be without pleasant
and profitable amusement at any time. It treats of directions
for every season of the year, in and out of doors, and on land
and water. One of the best things about it is that it furnishes
employment for a boy’s ingenuity and mechanical skill. It seems as
if this book must be destined to an immense popularity.”&mdash;<cite>The

<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">THE AMERICAN BOY’S HANDY BOOK</p>

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont">Or, What To Do and How To Do It</p>

<p class="center boldfont">By DANIEL C. BEARD</p>

<p class="center boldfont">One volume, 8vo, fully Illustrated by the Author, $2.00</p>

<p>Mr. Beard’s book tells the active, inventive, and practical American
boy the things he really wants to know; the thousand things he wants to
do, and the ten thousand ways in which he can do them, with the helps
and ingenious contrivances which every boy can either procure or make.
The author divides the book among the sports of the four seasons; and
he has made an almost exhaustive collection of the cleverest modern
devices, besides himself inventing an immense number of capital and
practical ideas.</p>
